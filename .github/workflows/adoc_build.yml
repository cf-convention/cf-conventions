#
# GitHub Actions Workflow for building and publishing the CF conventions and
# conformance docs.
#
# Pull request events against the main branch trigger jobs to build the
# documents. If successful, the resulting html and pdf files are uploaded as
# artifacts to make it easier to preview the impacts of a PR on the
# documentation.
#
# When a PR is accepted and merged into main, the documents are built and
# published to the root directory of the gh-pages branch.
#
# When a GitHub release is published, the documents are built and published to
# on the gh-pages branch in a directory named after the release (e.g. v1.9.0/).
#
