# GitHub Actions Workflow for pull request events against the master branch to
# make sure Asciidoctor still builds. If successful, the resulting html and
# pdf files are uploaded as artifacts to make it easier to preview the results
# of a PR.

# For more information on the actions used in this workflow, please see:
