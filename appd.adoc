== Parametric Vertical Coordinates

The definitions given here allow an application to compute dimensional
coordinate values from the parametric vertical coordinate values (usually
dimensionless) and associated variables. The formulas are expressed for a
gridpoint `(n,k,j,i)` where `i` and `j` are the horizontal indices, `k` is the
vertical index and `n` is the time index. A coordinate variable is associated
with its definition by the value of the `standard_name` attribute. The terms in
the definition are associated with file variables by the `formula_terms`
attribute. The `formula_terms` attribute takes a string value, the string being
comprised of blank-separated elements of the form \"``term: variable``", where
`term` is a case-insensitive keyword that represents one of the terms in the
definition, and `variable` is the name of the variable in a netCDF file that
contains the values for that term. The order of elements is not significant.

The gridpoint indices are not formally part of the definitions, but are included to illustrate the indices that __might__ be present in the file variables. For example, a vertical coordinate whose definition contains a time index is not necessarily time dependent in all netCDF files. Also, the definitions are given in general forms that may be simplified by omitting certain terms. A term that is omitted from the **`formula_terms`** attribute should be assumed to be zero.

The variables containing the terms may optionally have `standard_name`
attributes, with values as indicated in this Appendix. The `standard_name` of
the dimensional coordinate values which are computed by the formula may
optionally be specified by the `computed_standard_name` attribute of the
vertical coordinate variable, as indicated in this Appendix. A
`computed_standard_name` is uniquely implied by the formula in some cases,
while in others it depends on the `standard_name` of one or more of the terms,
with which it must be consistent.

===  Atmosphere hybrid sigma pressure coordinate 


----

standard_name = "atmosphere_hybrid_sigma_pressure_coordinate"
                
----

 

Definition::: 
+
----

p(n,k,j,i) = a(k)*p0 + b(k)*ps(n,j,i)
                     
----

+

The choice of whether **`a(k)`** or **`ap(k)`** is used depends on model formulation; the former is a dimensionless fraction, the latter a pressure value. In both formulations, **`b(k)`** is a dimensionless fraction.

where `z(n,k,j,i)` is the height above the datum (e.g. the geoid, which is
approximately mean sea level) at gridpoint `(k,j,i)` and `time (n)`,
`orog(n,j,i)` is the height of the surface above the datum at `(j,i)` and `time
(n)`, and `a(k)` and `b(k)` are the coordinates which define hybrid height
level `k`. `a(k)` has the dimensions of height and `b(i)` is dimensionless.

The format for the **`formula_terms`** attribute is 
----

formula_terms = "a: var1 b: var2 orog: var3"
        
----

 

The `standard_name` of `orog` may be `surface_altitude` (i.e. above the geoid)
or `surface_height_above_geopotential_datum`. The `computed_standard_name` is
`altitude` or `height_above_geopotential_datum` in these cases respectively. No
`standard_name` has been defined for `b`. There is no dimensionless coordinate
because `a`, which has the `standard_name` of
`atmosphere_hybrid_height_coordinate`, is the best choice for a level-dependent
but geographically constant coordinate.

approximately mean sea level) at gridpoint `(k,j,i)` and time `(n)`, `ztop` is
the height of the top of the model above the datum, and `a(k)`, `b1(k)`, and
`b2(k)` are the dimensionless coordinates which define hybrid level `k`.

small-scale components of the topography, and `a`, `b1` and `b2` are all
functions of the dimensionless SLEVE coordinate. See Shaer et al <<SCH02>> for
details.

The format for the **`formula_terms`** attribute is

The `standard_name` of `ztop` may be `altitude_at_top_of_atmosphere_model`
(i.e.  above the geoid) or
`height_above_geopotential_datum_at_top_of_atmosphere_model`.  The
`computed_standard_name` is `altitude` or `height_above_geopotential_datum` in
these cases respectively. No `standard_name` has been defined for `b1`,
`zsurf1`, `b2` or `zsurf2`.
