==  Reduction of Dataset Size 

There are two methods for reducing dataset size: packing and compression. By packing we mean altering the data in a way that reduces its precision. By compression we mean techniques that store the data more efficiently and result in no precision loss. Compression only works in certain circumstances, e.g., when a variable contains a significant amount of missing or repeated data values. In this case it is possible to make use of standard utilities, e.g., UNIX **`compress`** or GNU **`gzip`** , to compress the entire file after it has been written. In this section we offer an alternative compression method that is applied on a variable by variable basis. This has the advantage that only one variable need be uncompressed at a given time. The disadvantage is that generic utilities that don't recognize the CF conventions will not be able to operate on compressed variables.




[[packed-data, Section 8.1, "Packed Data"]]
=== Packed Data

At the current time the netCDF interface does not provide for packing data. However a simple packing may be achieved through the use of the optional NUG defined attributes **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** . After the data values of a variable have been read, they are to be multiplied by the **`scale_factor`** , and have **`add_offset`** added to them. If both attributes are present, the data are scaled before the offset is added. When scaled data are written, the application should first subtract the offset and then divide by the scale factor. The units of a variable should be representative of the unpacked data.

This standard is more restrictive than the NUG with respect to the use of the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes; ambiguities and precision problems related to data type conversions are resolved by these restrictions. If the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes are of the same data type as the associated variable, the unpacked data is assumed to be of the same data type as the packed data. However, if the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes are of a different data type from the variable (containing the packed data) then the unpacked data should match the type of these attributes, which must both be of type **`float`** or both be of type **`double`** . An additional restriction in this case is that the variable containing the packed data must be of type **`byte`** , **`short`** or **`int`** . It is not advised to unpack an **`int`** into a **`float`** as there is a potential precision loss.

When data to be packed contains missing values the attributes that indicate missing values ( **`_FillValue`** , **`valid_min`** , **`valid_max`** , **`valid_range`** ) must be of the same data type as the packed data. See <<missing-data>> for a discussion of how applications should treat variables that have attributes indicating both missing values and transformations defined by a scale and/or offset.




[[compression-by-gathering, Section 8.2, "Compression by Gathering"]]
=== Compression by Gathering

To save space in the netCDF file, it may be desirable to eliminate points from data arrays that are invariably missing. Such a compression can operate over one or more adjacent axes, and is accomplished with reference to a list of the points to be stored. The list is constructed by considering a mask array that only includes the axes to be compressed, and then mapping this array onto one dimension without reordering. The list is the set of indices in this one-dimensional mask of the required points. In the compressed array, the axes to be compressed are all replaced by a single axis, whose dimension is the number of wanted points. The wanted points appear along this dimension in the same order they appear in the uncompressed array, with the unwanted points skipped over. Compression and uncompression are executed by looping over the list.

The list is stored as the coordinate variable for the compressed axis of the data array. Thus, the list variable and its dimension have the same name. The list variable has a string attribute **`compress`** , __containing a blank-separated list of the dimensions which were affected by the compression in the order of the CDL declaration of the uncompressed array__ . The presence of this attribute identifies the list variable as such. The list, the original dimensions and coordinate variables (including boundary variables), and the compressed variables with all the attributes of the uncompressed variables are written to the netCDF file. The uncompressed variables can be reconstituted exactly as they were using this information.

[[compression-by-coordinate-interpolation, Section 8.3, "Compression by Coordinate Interpolation"]]
=== Compression by Coordinate Interpolation

For some applications the coordinates of a data variable can require considerably more storage than the data itself. Space may be saved in the netCDF file by the storing coordinates at a lower resolution than the data which they describe. The uncompressed coordinate and auxiliary coordinate variables can be reconstituted by interpolation, from the lower resolution coordinate values to the domain of the data (i.e. the target domain). This process will likely result in a loss in accuracy (as opposed to precision) in the uncompressed variables, due to rounding and approximation errors in the interpolation calculations, but it is assumed that these errors will be small enough to not be of concern to user of the uncompressed dataset.

The lower resolution coordinates are stored in __tie point variables__. This terminology is chosen to acknowledge that, whilst the values of a tie point variable may be a subset (or superset, see section <<??>) of the uncompressed coordinate values, they are typically be different to some or all of them.

In addition to the tie point variables themselves, metadata definging the coordinate interpolation method is stored in attributes of the data variable and of the associated __interpolation variable__. The partitioning of metadata between the data variable and the interpolation variable has been designed to minimise redundancy and maximise the reusability of the interpolation variable within a dataset.

The metadata that define the interpolation formula and its inputs are complete, so that the results of the coordinate reconstitution process are well defined and of a predictable accuracy.

The data variable coordinate interpolation attributes may also be used on a domain variable (<<domain-variables>>) with the same effect.

[[compression-by-coordinate-tie-points, Section 8.3.1, "Tie Points and Interpolation Zones"]]
==== Tie Points and Interpolation Zones

Reconstitution of the uncompressed coordinate and auxiliary coordinate variables is based on interpolation. To accomplish this, the target domain is segmented into smaller __interpolation zones__, for each of which the interpolation method is applied independently. For one dimensional interpolation, an interpolation zone is defined by two tie points, one at each end of the interpolation zone; for two-dimensional interpolation, an interpolation zone is defined by four tie points, one at each corner of a rectangular area aligned with the domain axes; etc. For the reconstitution of the uncompressed coordinate and auxiliary coordinate variables within an interpolation zone, the interpolation method is permitted to access the coordinates of the defining tie points, but not the coordinates of any other tie points.  

Although the coordinate and auxiliary coordinate variables are stored in orthogonal multidimensional array representation, the actual coordinate values may contain discontinuities. A discontinuity could be an overlap or a gap in the coordinates, or a change in cell size or cell alignment. As an example, such discontinuities are common in remote sensing data and may be caused by combinations of the instrument scan motion, the motion of the sensor platform and changes in the instrument scan mode. In such cases the location of the discontinuities in the coordinate values can be based either on knowledge of how the data set was created, e.g. by a remote sensing instrument, or alternatively by inspection of the actual coordinates.

As the interpolation methods rely on a certain regularity and continuity of the coordinate values within each interpolation zone, special attention must be given to the discontinuities in the process of defining the interpolation zones. When discontinuities are present, the grid is first divided into multiple __interpolation areas__, each of which is free of grid discontinuities. When no discontinuities are present, the whole grid is a single interpolation area. Following this step, each interpolation area is segmented into interpolation zones. The processes of generating interpolation zones for a grid without discontinuities and for a grid with discontinuities is illustrated in <<interpolation_zone_generation>>.

Within an interpolation area, interpolation zones must share tie points with neighbouring interpolation zones. Between interpolation areas, interpolation zones are not permitted to share tie points. This results in a different number of tie points in the two cases shown in <<interpolation_zone_generation>>.

For each interpolation dimension, the location of the tie points is defined by a corresponding __tie point index variable__, which also indicates the location of the interpolation areas (<<compression-by-coordinate-interpolation-tie-point-indices>>).

For each interpolation dimension, the number interpolation zones is equal to the number of tie points minus the number of interpolation areas.

[[compression-by-coordinate-tie-points-attribute, Section 8.3.2, "Tie Points Attribute"]]
==== Tie Points Attribute

To indicate that coordinate interpolation is required, a **`tie_points`** attribute must be defined for a data variable. This is a string attribute that both identifies the tie point variables, and maps non-overlapping subsets of them to their corresponding interpolation variables. It is a blank-separated list of words of the form "__tie_point_variable: [tie_point_variable: ...] interpolation_variable [tie_point_variable: [tie_point_variable: ...] interpolation_variable ...]__". For example, to specify that the tie point variables **`lat`** and **`lon`** are to be interpolated according to the interpolation variable **`bi_linear`** could be indicated with **`lat: lon: bi_linear`**.

[[compression-by-coordinate-interpolation-dimensions,Section 8.3.3, "Data Variable Attributes"]]
==== Interpolation and Non-Interpolation Dimensions

For each interpolation variable identified in the **`tie_points`** attribute, all corresponding tie point variables must share the same set of one or more dimensions. This set of dimensions must contain at least one __tie point interpolation dimension__ that corresponds to an __interpolation dimension__, i.e. a target domain dimension for which coordinate interpolation is required; and may additionally contain one or more __non-interpolation dimensions__, i.e. those of the target domain for which no coordinate interpolation is required.

An interpolation dimension typically differs in size from the corresponding tie point interpolation dimension. For example, if the target domain dimensions are **`xc = 30`** and **`yc = 10`**,  interpolation could be applied in both of these dimensions, based on tie point variables of the dimensions **`tp_xc = 4`** and **`tp_yc = 2`**. Here, **`tp_xc`** is the tie point interpolation dimension related to the interpolation dimension **`xc`**, and **`tp_yc`** is the tie point interpolation dimension related to the interpolation dimension **`yc`**.

The presence of non-interpolation dimensions in the tie point variable impacts the interpolation process in that there must be a separate application of the interpolation method for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions. For example, if the target domain dimensions are **`xc = 30`** and **`yc = 10`**, interpolation could be applied in the **`xc`** dimension only, based on tie point variables of the dimensions **`tp_xc = 4`** and **`yc = 10`**. The interpolation in the **`xc`** dimension would then be repeated for each of the 10 indices of the **`yc`** dimension.

[[compression-by-coordinate-interpolation-tie-point-indices, Section 8.3.4, "Tie Point Indices"]]
==== Tie Point Indices

The relationship between a tie point interpolation dimension and its corresponding interpolation dimension is defined with a __tie point index variable__. This contains zero-based indices that relate each element of a tie point interpolation dimension to its related location in the corresponding interpolation dimension. The tie point index variable is a one-dimensional integer variable that spans a tie point interpolation dimension. The values must be strictly monotonically increasing within interpolation areas, and two adjacent indices that are equal, or differ by one, indicates the location of an interpolation area boundary relating to an grid discontinuity (<<compression-by-coordinate-tie-points>>).

When tie point variables represent a subset of the uncompressed coordinates, each value of the tie point index variable is the index of the interpolation dimension that corresponds to the corresponding tie point interpolation dimension.

Conversely, when tie point variables represent a superset of the uncompressed coordinates, each value of the tie point index variable is the index of the tie point interpolation dimension that corresponds to the corresponding interpolation dimension. This situation could occur when a hierarchy of different resolution representations of data are stored in different data variables. Space can be saved by storing the highest resolution coordinates, and using tie point indices with an interpolation variable to derive the lower resolution coordinates. Such a superset is identifiable by there being a unique interpolation area and the size of the tie point interpolation dimension being strictly greater than than the size of interpolation dimension.

For instance, in example <<Two-dimensional-tie-point-interpolation>> the tie point variables represent a subset of the target domain and tie point index variable **`int x_indices(tp_xc)`** contains the indices **`x_indices = 0, 9, 19, 29`** that identify location of the interpolation dimension **`xc`** of size 30. However, in example <<??> the tie point index variables represent a superset of the target domain and so in this case the same indices are identifying locations of the tie point interpolation dimension.

To indicate which tie point index variable applies to each interpolation dimension, a **`tie_point_indices`** attribute must be defined for the data variable. This is a string attribute that maps the interpolation dimensions to the corresponding tie point index variables. It is a blank-separated list of words of the form "__interpolation_dimension: tie_point_index_variable [interpolation_dimension: tie_point_index_variable ...]__". Continuing the above example, specifying that the target dimension **`xc`** and **`yc`** are associated with the tie point index variables **`x_indices`** and **`y_indices`** respectively, could be indicated with **`xc: x_indices yc: y_indices`**.

The **`tie_point_indices`** attribute also serves to identify the corresponding tie point interpolation dimensions, as each tie point index variable spans a unique tie point interpolation dimension. In the example, interpolation dimension **`xc`** references tie point index variable **`x_indices`**, which in turn identifies tie point interpolation dimension **`tp_xc`**.

[[compression-by-coordinate-interpolation-tie-point-indices, Section 8.3.5, "Tie Point Offsets"]]
==== Tie Point Offsets

By default, it is assumed that the tie points are a subset of the uncompressed coordinates. However, it may be that the tie points are offset from a subset of the uncompressed coordinates. In this case, the data variable requires a **`tie_point_offsets`** attribute to record the nature of this offset.

The **`tie_point_offsets`** attribute is a string attribute maps interpolation dimensions to the corresponding __tie point offset variables__. It is a blank-separated list of words of the form "__interpolation_dimension: tie_point_offset_variable [interpolation_dimension: tie_point_offset_variable ...]__".

This mapping is not part of the interpolation variable because different data variables may apply the same interpolation method, with the same tie points variables, but with different offsets.

A tie point offset variable defines numerical offsets in terms of the fraction of the size of a target domain cell along a single dimension. When associated with an interpolation dimension by the **`tie_point_offsets`** attribute, this offset locates the tie point variable coordinates relative to the uncompressed coordinates. A tie point offset variable may be a scalar, or else its dimensions may include the tie point interpolation dimension corresponding to the named interpolation dimension, as well as any subset of the non-interpolation dimensions. No other dimensions may be spanned by a tie point offset variable.

An offset value, which must be in the open range `(-1.0, 1.0)`, indicates a tie point offset towards an adjacent element of the corresponding interpolation dimension as follows: A positive offset value indicates a tie point offset towards the next element, and a negative offset indicates a tie point offset towards the previous element. Note that the location of the offset does not depend on whether the uncompressed coordinates are increasing or decreasing along the interpolation dimension.

For example, specifying that for both of the interpolation dimensions **`track`** and **`scan`** the offset is `-0.5` (indicating that the tie points are offset by half a grid cell along each dimension from their corresponding uncompressed coordinates), could be indicated with a **`tie_point_offsets`** attribute of **`track: offset scan: offset`**, where **`offset`** is a scalar tie point variable that has the value **`offset = -0.5`**.

[[compression-by-coordinate-interpolation-interpolation-variable, Section 8.3.6, "Interpolation Variable"]]
==== Interpolation Variable

The method used to uncompress the tie point variables is described by an interpolation variable that acts as a container for the attributes that define the interpolation technique and the parameters that should be used. The variable should be a scalar (i.e. it has no dimensions) of arbitrary type, and the value of its single element is immaterial.

The interpolation method must be identified in one of two ways. Either by the **`interpolation_name`** attribute, which takes a string value that contains the method's name, or else by the **`interpolation_description`** attribute, which takes a string value that contains a non-standardized description of the method. These attributes must not be both set.

The valid values of **`interpolation_name`** are given in Appendix <?>. This appendix also describes the interpolation technique and optional interpolation variable attributes for configuring the interpolation process.

If a standardized interpolation name is not given, the interpolation variable must have a **`interpolation_description`** attribute defined instead, containing a description of the non-standardised interpolation (in a similar manner to a long name being used instead of a standard name). This description is free text that can take any form (including a URI, for example). Whilst it is recommended that a standardised interpolation is provided, the alternative is provided to promote interoperability in cases where a well defined user community needs to use sophisticated interpolation techniques that may also be under development.

The definition of the interpolation method, however it is specified, may include instructions to treat groups of physically related coordinates simultaneously, if such tie points are present. For example, there are cases where longitudes cannot be interpolated without considering the corresponding latitudes. It is up to the interpolation description to describe how such coordinates are to be identified (e.g. it may be that such tie point variables require particular units or standard names).

An interpolation method may require __interpolation coefficient variables__ that provide values for interpolation equation terms that are not satisfied by the tie points. Such terms in the interpolation equations are associated with interpolation coefficient variables by the **`interpolation_coefficients`** attribute that takes a string value, the string being comprised of blank-separated elements of the form `"term: variable"`, where `term` is a case-insensitive keyword that represents one of the terms in the interpolation equations, and `variable` is the name of the interpolation coefficient variable that contains the values for that term. The order of elements is not significant. A term that is omitted from the **`interpolation_coefficients`** attribute should be assumed to be zero.

The interpolation variable attribute **`interpolation_configuration`** may be used to configure the interpolation process. This attribute names other __interpolation configuration variables__ that contain parameters needed to correctly configure the interpolation process. The **`interpolation_configuration`** attribute takes a string value, the string being comprised of blank-separated elements of the form `"term: variable"`, where `term` is a case-insensitive keyword that represents one of the terms in the interpolation method definition, and `variable` is the name of the interpolation configuration variable that contains the values for that term. The order of elements is not significant.

The **`interpolation_coefficient`** and **`interpolation_configuration`** attributes may only be provided if allowed by  the definition of the interpolation method.

The variables named by the **`interpolation_coefficients`** and **`interpolation_configuration`** attributes must either be scalar, or else their dimensions may include, for each interpolation dimension, either the corresponding tie point interpolation dimension or the corresponding __interpolation zone dimension__, but not both, and may include any of the non-interpolation dimensions. An interpolation zone dimension is a dimension whose size is equal to the number of interpolation zones along a particular interpolation dimension. Note that an interpolation zone dimension size is the same as the number of tie points along the corresponding interpolation dimension, minus the number of interpolation areas.

If an interpolation coefficent or configuration variable spans the interpolation zone dimensions corresponding to all of the interpolation dimensions, then it defines a separate value for each interpolation zone. If, however, a variable spans at least one tie point interpolation dimension, then each of its values is shared by the interpolation zones that are adjacent in the dimensions defined by tie point interpolation dimensions. The former case is akin to values being defined at the centre of interpolation zones. The latter case is akin to values being defined at interpolation zone boundaries, and therefore equally applicable to both interpolation zones that share that boundary (<<interpolation_variable>>).

[[interpolation_variable, figure 4]]

.Interpolation coefficients and interpolation flags variable dimensions in relation to an interpolation zone and its boundaries.

image::images/interpolation_variables.png[,100%,pdfwidth=50vw,align="center"]


Note that the interpolation method is always applied on a per interpolation zone basis, for which the construction of the uncompressed coordinates may only access the tie point that define the extent of the of the interpolation zone, as well as any interpolation coefficient and configuration variables defined for the interpolation zone, including its boundaries.


[[compression-by-coordinate-interpolation-bounds, Section 8.3.6, "Interpolation of Tie Point Bounds"]]
==== Interpolation of Tie Point Bounds

If a tie point variable has cell boundaries bounds then it must have the attribute **`bounds`** that names the variable that contains the vertices of the cell boundaries. The bounds should be the same as the bounds of the corresponding target grid cells, unless there is a non-zero offset, in which case the offset applies to the bounds values in exactly the same manner as it does to the cell coordinates. It is thereforefore likely that tie point cells will be non-contiguous.

The target domain cell bounds are calculated by interpolating each cell bound position independently of the others, using the same interpolation method and tie point index variables as used for the cell coordinates. In this case, though, the tie point index variables are the indentifying target domain cells to which the bounds apply, rather than bounds values themselves. For instance, in the case of a two-dimensionsal tie point variable with four-sided cells then the target domain cell bounds would be calculated with four separate interpolations, one for each of the bounds positions (following the notation of <<cell-boundaries>>) `(j-1,i-1)`, `(j-1,i+1)`, `(j+1,i+1)`, `(j+1,i-1)`.

Note that an implementation of the interpolation method is free to calculate the uncompressed bounds locations in the manner of its choosing, as a long as the result is formally equivalent to each bounds position being treated independently.
