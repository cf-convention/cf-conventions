==  Reduction of Dataset Size 

There are three methods for reducing dataset size: packing, lossless compression, and lossy compression. By packing we mean altering the data in a way that reduces its precision (but has no other effect on accuracy). By lossless compression we mean techniques that store the data more efficiently and result in no loss of precision or accuracy. By lossy compression we mean techniques that store the data more efficiently and retain its precision but result in some loss in accuracy.

Lossless compression only works in certain circumstances, e.g., when a variable contains a significant amount of missing or repeated data values. In this case it is possible to make use of standard utilities, e.g., UNIX **`compress`** or GNU **`gzip`** , to compress the entire file after it has been written. In this section we offer an alternative compression method that is applied on a variable by variable basis. This has the advantage that only one variable need be uncompressed at a given time. The disadvantage is that generic utilities that don't recognize the CF conventions will not be able to operate on compressed variables.




[[packed-data, Section 8.1, "Packed Data"]]
=== Packed Data

At the current time the netCDF interface does not provide for packing data. However a simple packing may be achieved through the use of the optional NUG defined attributes **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** . After the data values of a variable have been read, they are to be multiplied by the **`scale_factor`** , and have **`add_offset`** added to them. If both attributes are present, the data are scaled before the offset is added. When scaled data are written, the application should first subtract the offset and then divide by the scale factor. The units of a variable should be representative of the unpacked data.

This standard is more restrictive than the NUG with respect to the use of the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes; ambiguities and precision problems related to data type conversions are resolved by these restrictions. If the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes are of the same data type as the associated variable, the unpacked data is assumed to be of the same data type as the packed data. However, if the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes are of a different data type from the variable (containing the packed data) then the unpacked data should match the type of these attributes, which must both be of type **`float`** or both be of type **`double`** . An additional restriction in this case is that the variable containing the packed data must be of type **`byte`** , **`short`** or **`int`** . It is not advised to unpack an **`int`** into a **`float`** as there is a potential precision loss.

When data to be packed contains missing values the attributes that indicate missing values ( **`_FillValue`** , **`valid_min`** , **`valid_max`** , **`valid_range`** ) must be of the same data type as the packed data. See <<missing-data>> for a discussion of how applications should treat variables that have attributes indicating both missing values and transformations defined by a scale and/or offset.




[[compression-by-gathering, Section 8.2, "Lossless Compression by Gathering"]]
=== Lossless Compression by Gathering

To save space in the netCDF file, it may be desirable to eliminate points from data arrays that are invariably missing. Such a compression can operate over one or more adjacent axes, and is accomplished with reference to a list of the points to be stored. The list is constructed by considering a mask array that only includes the axes to be compressed, and then mapping this array onto one dimension without reordering. The list is the set of indices in this one-dimensional mask of the required points. In the compressed array, the axes to be compressed are all replaced by a single axis, whose dimension is the number of wanted points. The wanted points appear along this dimension in the same order they appear in the uncompressed array, with the unwanted points skipped over. Compression and uncompression are executed by looping over the list.

The list is stored as the coordinate variable for the compressed axis of the data array. Thus, the list variable and its dimension have the same name. The list variable has a string attribute **`compress`** , __containing a blank-separated list of the dimensions which were affected by the compression in the order of the CDL declaration of the uncompressed array__ . The presence of this attribute identifies the list variable as such. The list, the original dimensions and coordinate variables (including boundary variables), and the compressed variables with all the attributes of the uncompressed variables are written to the netCDF file. The uncompressed variables can be reconstituted exactly as they were using this information.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling, Section 8.3, "Lossy Compression by Coordinate Subsampling"]]
=== Lossy Compression by Coordinate Subsampling

For some applications the coordinates of a data variable can require
considerably more storage than the data itself. Space may be saved in
the netCDF file by storing a subsample of the coordinates that describe
the data. The uncompressed coordinate and auxiliary coordinate
variables can be reconstituted by interpolation, from the subsampled
coordinate values to the domain of the data (i.e. the target
domain). This process will likely result in a loss in accuracy (as
opposed to precision) in the uncompressed variables, due to rounding
and approximation errors in the interpolation calculations, but it is
assumed that these errors will be small enough to not be of concern to
users of the uncompressed dataset. The creator of the compressed
dataset can control the accuracy of the reconstituted coordinates
through the degree of subsampling and the choice of interpolation
method, see <<Appendix J>>.

The subsampled coordinates are called __tie points__ and are stored in
__tie point coordinate variables__.

In addition to the tie point coordinate variables themselves, metadata defining the coordinate interpolation method is stored in attributes of the data variable and of the associated __interpolation variable__. The partitioning of metadata between the data variable and the interpolation variable has been designed to minimise redundancy and maximise the reusability of the interpolation variable within a dataset.

The metadata that define the interpolation formula and its inputs are complete, so that the results of the coordinate reconstitution process are well defined and of a predictable accuracy.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points-and-interpolation-subareas, Section 8.3.1, "Tie Points and Interpolation Subareas"]]
==== Tie Points and Interpolation Subareas

Reconstitution of the uncompressed coordinate and auxiliary coordinate
variables is based on interpolation. To accomplish this, the target
domain is segmented into smaller __interpolation subareas__, for each of
which the interpolation method is applied independently. For
one-dimensional interpolation, an interpolation subarea is defined by two
tie points, one at each end of the interpolation subarea; for
two-dimensional interpolation, an interpolation subarea is defined by
four tie points, one at each corner of a rectangular area aligned with
the domain axes; etc. For the reconstitution of the uncompressed
coordinate and auxiliary coordinate variables within an interpolation
subarea, the interpolation method is permitted to access its defining tie
points, and no others.

As an interpolation method relies on the regularity and continuity of
the coordinate values within each interpolation subarea, special
attention must be given to the case when uncompressed coordinates
contain discontinuities. A discontinuity could be an overlap or a gap
in the coordinates' coverage, or a change in cell size or cell
alignment. As an example, such discontinuities are common in remote
sensing data and may be caused by combinations of the instrument scan
motion, the motion of the sensor platform and changes in the
instrument scan mode. When discontinuities are present, the domain is
first divided into multiple __continuous areas__, each of which is
free of discontinuities. When no discontinuities are present, the
whole domain is a single continuous area. Following this step, each
continuous area is segmented into interpolation subareas. The
processes of generating interpolation subareas for a domain without
discontinuities and for a domain with discontinuities is illustrated
in <<interpolation_subarea_generation>>, and described in more detail in
<<Appendix J>>.

For each __interpolated dimension__, i.e. a target domain dimension for which coordinate interpolation is required, the locations of the tie point coordinates are defined by a corresponding __tie point index variable__, which also indicates the locations of the continuous areas (<<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-index-mapping>>).
 
The interpolation subareas within a continuous area do not overlap, ensuring that each coordinate of an interpolated dimension is computed from a unique interpolation subarea. These interpolation subareas, however, share the tie point coordinates that define their common boundaries. Such a shared tie point coordinate can only be located in one of a pair of adjacent interpolation subareas, which is always the first of the pair in index space. For instance, in <<interpolation_subarea_generation>>, the interpolation subarea labeled `(0,0)` contains all four of its tie point coordinates, and the interpolation subarea `(0,1)` only contains two of them. When applied for a given interpolation subarea, interpolation methods (such as those described in <<Appendix J>>) must ensure that reconstituted coordinate points are only generated inside the interpolation subarea being processed, even if some of the tie point coordinates lie outside of that interpolation subarea.
 
Adjacent interpolation subareas that are in different continuous areas never share tie point coordinates, as  consequence of the grid discontinuity between them. This results in a different number of tie point coordinates in the two cases shown in <<interpolation_subarea_generation>>.



For each interpolated dimension, the number of interpolation subareas is equal to the number of tie points minus the number of continuous areas.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points-attribute, Section 8.3.2, "Coordinate Interpolation Attribute"]]
==== Coordinate Interpolation Attribute

To indicate that coordinate interpolation is required, a **`coordinate_interpolation`** attribute must be defined for a data variable. This is a string attribute that both identifies the tie point coordinate variables, and maps non-overlapping subsets of them to their corresponding interpolation variables. It is a blank-separated list of words of the form "__tie_point_coordinate_variable: [tie_point_coordinate_variable: ...] interpolation_variable [tie_point_coordinate_variable: [tie_point_coordinate_variable: ...] interpolation_variable ...]__". For example, to specify that the tie point coordinate variables `lat` and `lon` are to be interpolated according to the interpolation variable `bi_linear` could be indicated with `lat: lon: bi_linear`.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-variable, Section 8.3.3, "Interpolation Variable"]]
==== Interpolation Variable

The method used to uncompress the tie point coordinate variables is described by
an interpolation variable that acts as a container for the attributes
that define the interpolation technique and the parameters that should
be used. The variable should be a scalar (i.e. it has no dimensions)
of arbitrary type, and the value of its single element is immaterial.

The interpolation method must be identified in one of two ways. Either
by the **`interpolation_name`** attribute, which takes a string value
that contains the method's name, or else by the
**`interpolation_description`** attribute, which takes a string value
that contains a non-standardized description of the method. These
attributes must not be both set.

The valid values of **`interpolation_name`** are given in <<Appendix
J>>. This appendix describes the interpolation technique for each
method, and optional interpolation variable attributes for configuring
the interpolation process.

If a standardized interpolation name is not given, the interpolation
variable must have an **`interpolation_description`** attribute
defined instead, containing a description of the non-standardised
interpolation (in a similar manner to a long name being used instead
of a standard name). This description is free text that can take any
form (including fully qualified URLs, for example). Whilst it is
recommended that a standardised interpolation is provided, the
alternative is provided to promote interoperability in cases where a
well defined user community needs to use sophisticated interpolation
techniques that may also be under development.

The definition of the interpolation method, however it is specified,
may include instructions to treat groups of physically related
coordinates simultaneously, if such tie points are present. For
example, there are cases where longitudes cannot be interpolated
without considering the corresponding latitudes. It is up to the
interpolation description to describe how such coordinates are to be
identified (e.g. it may be that such tie point coordinate variables require
particular units or standard names).

Note that the interpolation method is always applied on a per
interpolation subarea basis, for which the construction of the
uncompressed coordinates may only access those tie points that define
the extent of the of the interpolation subarea.

In addition to the **`interpolation_name`** and **`interpolation_description`** attributes described in this section, further attributes of the interpolation variable are described in <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute>> and <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-parameters>>.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-dimensions,Section 8.3.4, "Subsampled, Interpolated and Non-Interpolated Dimensions"]]
==== Subsampled, Interpolated and Non-Interpolated Dimensions

For each interpolation variable identified in the 
**`coordinate_interpolation`** attribute, all of the associated tie point
coordinate variables must share the same set of one or more dimensions. 
This set of dimensions must correspond to the set of dimensions of the 
uncompressed coordinate or auxiliary coordinate variables, such that each 
of these dimensions must be either the uncompressed dimension itself, or 
a dimension that is to be interpolated to the uncompressed dimension.

Dimensions of the tie point coordinate variable which are to be 
interpolated are called __subsampled dimensions__, and 
the corresponding data variable dimensions are called __interpolated 
dimensions__, while those for which no interpolation is required, 
being the same in the data variable and the tie point coordinate 
variable, are called __non-interpolated dimensions__. The dimensions 
of a tie point coordinate variable must contain at least one  
subsampled dimension, for each of which the corresponding 
interpolated dimension cannot be included.

The size of a subsampled dimension will be less than the 
size of the corresponding interpolated dimension. For example, if the 
interpolated dimensions are `xc = 30` and `yc = 10`,  interpolation 
could be applied in both of these dimensions, based on tie point 
variables of the dimensions `tp_xc = 4` and `tp_yc = 2`. Here, 
`tp_xc` is the subsampled dimension related to the 
interpolated dimension `xc`, and `tp_yc` is the  
subsampled dimension related to the interpolated dimension `yc`.

The presence of non-interpolated dimensions in the tie point coordinate variable
impacts the interpolation process in that there must be a separate
application of the interpolation method for each combination of
indices of the non-interpolated dimensions. For example, if
`xc = 30` is an interpolated dimension and `yc = 10` 
is a non-interpolated dimension, interpolation
could be applied in the `xc` dimension only, based on tie point
variables that have the subsampled dimension `tp_xc = 4` and the 
non-interpolated dimension `yc = 10`. The
interpolation in the `xc` dimension would then be repeated for each of
the 10 indices of the `yc` non-interpolated dimension.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute, Section 8.3.5, "Tie Point Mapping Attribute"]]
==== Tie Point Mapping Attribute

The **`tie_point_mapping`** attribute provides mapping at two levels. It associates
subsampled dimensions with the corresponding target dimensions, and for each 
of these sets of corresponding dimensions, it associates index values
of the subsampled dimension with index values of the target dimension, thereby 
uniquely associating the tie points with their corresponding location in the 
target domain.

The mappings are stored in the interpolation variable's
**`tie_point_mapping`** attribute that contains a blank-separated
list of words of the form __"interpolated_dimension: tie_point_index_variable
subsampled_dimension [interpolation_subarea_dimension]
[interpolated_dimension: ...]"__, the details of which are described in the following two sections.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimension-mapping, Section 8.3.6, "Tie Point Dimension Mapping"]]
==== Tie Point Dimension Mapping

The **`tie_point_mapping`** attribute defined above associates 
each interpolated dimension with its corresponding subsampled 
 dimension and, if required, its corresponding 
 __interpolation subarea dimension__ that defines the number of
interpolation subareas which partition the interpolated dimension. 
It is only required to associate an interpolated dimension  
to an interpolation subarea dimension in the case that the interpolation 
subarea dimension is spanned by an interpolation parameter variable, 
as described in
<<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-parameters>>. 
If an interpolation subarea dimension is provided then it must be 
the second of the two named dimensions following the tie point index variable.

Note that the size of an interpolation subarea dimension is, by definition, the size of the corresponding subsampled dimension minus the number of continuous areas.

An overview of the different dimensions for coordinate interpolation is shown in <<ci_dimensions_overview>>.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-index-mapping, Section 8.3.7, "Tie Point Index Mapping"]]
==== Tie Point Index Mapping

The **`tie_point_mapping`** attribute defined in 
<<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute>>
identifies for each subsampled dimension a tie point index variable. The tie 
point index variable defines the relationship between the indices of 
the subsampled dimension and the indices of its
corresponding interpolated dimension. 

A tie point index variable is a one-dimensional
integer variable that must span the subsampled dimension. Each tie point
index variable value is a zero-based index of the related
interpolated dimension which maps an element of that interpolated
dimension to the corresponding location in the subsampled
dimension. 

The tie point index values must be strictly monotonically increasing. The location in index space of a continuous area boundary that relates to a grid discontinuity (<<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points-and-interpolation-subareas>>) is indicated by a pair of adjacent tie point index values differing by one. In this case, each tie point index of the pair defines a boundary of a different continuous area. As a consequence, any pair of tie point index values that defines an extent of an interpolation subarea must differ by two or more, i.e. in general, an interpolation subarea spans at least two points in each of its interpolated dimensions. Interpolation subareas that are the first in index space of a continuous area, in one or more of the subsampled dimensions are, however, special. These interpolation subareas contain tie points at both of the subarea boundaries with respect to those subsampled dimensions and so must span at least three points in the corresponding interpolated dimensions (see <<interpolation_subarea_generation>>).

For instance, in example <<example-Two-dimensional-tie-point-interpolation>>
the tie point coordinate variables represent a subset of the target domain and
the tie point index variable `int x_indices(tp_xc)` contains the
indices `x_indices = 0, 9, 19, 29` that identify the location in the
interpolated dimension `xc` of size 30.  The corresponding **`tie_point_mapping`** attribute of the interpolation variable is `xc: x_indices tp_xc  yc: y_indices tp_yc`.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-parameters, Section 8.3.8, "Interpolation Parameters"]]
==== Interpolation Parameters

The interpolation variable attribute **`interpolation_parameters`**
may be used to provide extra information to the interpolation
process. This attribute names __interpolation parameter variables__
that provide values for coefficient terms in the interpolation
equation, or for any other terms that configure the interpolation
process. The **`interpolation_parameters`** attribute takes a string
value, the string comprising blank-separated elements of the form
`"term: variable"`, where `term` is a case-insensitive keyword that
defines one of the terms in the interpolation method's definition
given in <<Appendix J>>, and `variable` is the name of the
interpolation parameter variable that contains the values for that
term. The order of elements is not significant. A numerical term that
is omitted from the **`interpolation_parameters`** attribute should be
assumed to be zero.

The **`interpolation_parameters`** attribute may only be provided if
allowed by the definition of the interpolation method. Interpolation
parameters may always be provided to non-standardized interpolation
methods.

The interpolation parameter variable dimensions must include, for all of the interpolated dimensions, either the associated subsampled dimension or the associated interpolation subarea dimension. Additionally, any subset of zero or more of the non-interpolated dimensions of the tie point coordinate variable are permitted as interpolation parameter variable dimensions.

The application of an interpolation parameter variable is independent of its non-interpolated dimensions, but depends on its set of subsampled dimensions and interpolation subarea dimensions: 

* If the set only contains subsampled dimensions, then the variable provides values for every tie point and therefore equally applicable to the interpolation subareas that share that tie point, see example a) in figure 3;
* If the set only contains interpolation subarea dimensions, then the variable provides values for every interpolation subarea and therefore only applicable to that interpolation subarea, see example b) in figure 3;
* If the set contains both subsampled dimensions and interpolation subarea dimensions, then the variable’s values are to be shared by the interpolation subareas that are adjacent along each of the specified subsampled dimensions. This case is akin to the values being defined at the interpolation subarea boundaries, and therefore equally applicable to the interpolation subareas that share that boundary, see example c) and d) in figure 3;

[[ci_interpolation_parameters, figure 3]]

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-computational_precision, Section 8.3.9, "Computational Precision"]]
==== Computational Precision

The accuracy of the reconstituted coordinates depends mainly on the degree of subsampling and the choice of interpolation method, both of which are set by the creator of the dataset. The accuracy will also depend, however, on how the interpolation method is implemented and on the computer platform carrying out the computations. There are no restrictions on the choice of interpolation method implementation, for neither the data creator nor the data user, but the floating-point arithmetic precision used by the data creator during the preparation and validation of the compressed coordinates must be specified by setting the interpolation variable’s  **`computational_precision**` attribute to one of the following values:

[cols="3,10"]
|===============
| ** Value ** | ** Description** 
| "32" | 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, comparable to the binary32 standard in [<<IEEE_754>>]
| "64" | 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, comparable to the binary64 standard in [<<IEEE_754>>]
|===============


Using the given computational precision in the interpolation computations is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the data user to be able to reconstitute the coordinates to an accuracy comparable to that intended by the data creator. For instance, a **`computational_precision**` value of **`"64"**` would specify that, using the same software and hardware as the creator of the compressed dataset, sufficient accuracy could not be reached when using a floating-point precision lower than 64-bit floating-point arithmetic in the interpolation computations required to reconstitute the coordinates.

[[compression-by-coordinate-sampling-bounds, Section 8.3.10, "Interpolation of Tie Point Bounds"]]
==== Interpolation of Tie Point Bounds

If reconstituted coordinates have cell boundaries, then the corresponding tie point coordinate variable must also have cell boundaries, specified by the **`bounds`** attribute that names the variable that contains the vertices of the cell boundaries. 
The bounds of a tie point must be the same as the bounds of the target grid cells whose coordinates are specified as the tie point.
It is therefore likely that tie point cells will be non-contiguous.

The target domain cell bounds are calculated by interpolating each cell bound position independently of the others, using the same interpolation method and tie point index variables as used for the cell coordinates. In this case, though, the tie point index variables are the identifying target domain cells to which the bounds apply, rather than bounds values themselves. For instance, in the case of a two-dimensional tie point coordinate variable with four-sided cells, the target domain cell bounds would be calculated with four separate interpolations, one for each of the bounds positions (following the notation of <<cell-boundaries>>) `(j-1,i-1)`, `(j-1,i+1)`, `(j+1,i+1)`, `(j+1,i-1)`.

Note that an implementation of the interpolation method is free to calculate the uncompressed bounds locations in the manner of its choosing, as a long as the result is formally equivalent to each bounds position being treated independently.

This example demonstrates the use of multiple interpolation variables,
the reusability of the interpolation variable between data variables
of different dimensions and the use of the interpolation parameter
attribute.

In this the projection coordinates are two-dimensional, but are only
linearly interpolated in one of their dimensions - the one which is
given by the **`tie_point_mapping`** attribute.
