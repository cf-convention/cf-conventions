| Modifier | Units | Description

| `detection_minimum` | __u__
| The smallest data value which is regarded as a detectable signal.

| `number_of_observations` | 1
| The number of discrete observations or measurements from which a data
value has been derived. The use of this modifier is deprecated and the standard_name 
number_of_observations is preferred to describe this type of metadata variable. 

| `standard_error` | __u__
| The uncertainty of the data value. The standard error includes both
systematic and statistical uncertainty. By default it is assumed that
the values supplied are for one standard error. If the values supplied
are for some multiple of the standard error, the `standard_error`
ancillary variable should have an attribute
**`standard_error_multiplier`** stating the multiplication factor.

| `status_flag` |
| Flag values indicating the quality or other status of the data values.
The variable should have **`flag_values`** or **`flag_masks`** (or both)
and **`flag_meanings`** attributes to show how it should be interpreted
(<<flags>>). The use of this modifier is deprecated and the standard_name status_flag is 
preferred to describe this type of metadata variable.
