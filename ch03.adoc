==  Description of the Data 

The attributes described in this section are used to provide a description of the content and the units of measurement for each variable. We continue to support the use of the **`units`** and **`long_name`** attributes as defined in COARDS. We extend COARDS by adding the optional **`standard_name`** attribute which is used to provide unique identifiers for variables. This is important for data exchange since one cannot necessarily identify a particular variable based on the name assigned to it by the institution that provided the data.

The **`standard_name`** attribute can be used to identify variables that contain coordinate data. But since it is an optional attribute, applications that implement these standards must continue to be able to identify coordinate types based on the COARDS conventions.




[[units, Section 3.1, "Units"]]
=== Units

The **`units`** attribute is required for all variables that represent dimensional quantities (except for boundary variables defined in <<cell-boundaries>> and climatology variables defined in <<climatological-statistics>> ). The value of the **`units`** attribute is a string that can be recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package <<UDUNITS>>, with a few exceptions that are given below. The link:$$http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/$$[Udunits package] includes a file `udunits.dat`, which lists its supported unit names. Note that case is significant in the **`units`** strings.

The COARDS convention prohibits the unit `degrees` altogether, but this unit is not forbidden by the CF convention because it may in fact be appropriate for a variable containing, say, solar zenith angle. The unit `degrees` is also allowed on coordinate variables such as the latitude and longitude coordinates of a transformed grid. In this case the coordinate values are not true latitudes and longitudes which must always be identified using the more specific forms of `degrees` as described in <<latitude-coordinate>> and <<longitude-coordinate>>.

Units are not required for dimensionless quantities. A variable with no units attribute is assumed to be dimensionless. However, a units attribute specifying a dimensionless unit may optionally be included. The Udunits package defines a few dimensionless units, such as `percent`, but is lacking commonly used units such as ppm (parts per million). This convention does not support the addition of new dimensionless units that are not udunits compatible. The conforming unit for quantities that represent fractions, or parts of a whole, is "1". The conforming unit for parts per million is "1e-6". Descriptive information about dimensionless quantities, such as sea-ice concentration, cloud fraction, probability, etc., should be given in the **`long_name`** or **`standard_name`** attributes (see below) rather than the **`units`** .

The units `level`, `layer`, and `sigma_level` are allowed for dimensionless vertical coordinates to maintain backwards compatibility with COARDS. These units are not compatible with Udunits and are deprecated by this standard because conventions for more precisely identifying dimensionless vertical coordinates are introduced (see <<dimensionless-vertical-coordinate>>).

The Udunits syntax that allows scale factors and offsets to be applied to a unit is not supported by this standard. The application of any scale factors or offsets to data should be indicated by the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes. Use of these attributes for data packing, which is their most important application, is discussed in detail in <<packed-data>>.

Udunits recognizes the following prefixes and their abbreviations.

[[long-name, Section 3.2, "Long Name"]]
=== Long Name

The **`long_name`** attribute is defined by the NUG to contain a long descriptive name which may, for example, be used for labeling plots. For backwards compatibility with COARDS this attribute is optional. But it is highly recommended that either this or the **`standard_name`** attribute defined in the next section be provided to make the file self-describing. If a variable has no **`long_name`** attribute then an application may use, as a default, the **`standard_name`** if it exists, or the variable name itself.




[[standard-name, Section 3.3, "Standard Name"]]
=== Standard Name

A fundamental requirement for exchange of scientific data is the ability to describe precisely the physical quantities being represented. To some extent this is the role of the **`long_name`** attribute as defined in the NUG. However, usage of **`long_name`** is completely ad-hoc. For some applications it would be desirable to have a more definitive description of the quantity, which would allow users of data from different sources (some of which might be models and others observational) to determine whether quantities were in fact comparable. For this reason an optional mechanism for uniquely associating each variable with a standard name is provided.

A standard name is associated with a variable via the attribute **`standard_name`** which takes a string value comprised of a standard name optionally followed by one or more blanks and a standard name modifier (a string value from <<standard-name-modifiers>>).

The set of permissible standard names is contained in the standard name table. The table entry for each standard name contains the following:

standard name:: The name used to identify the physical quantity. A standard name contains no whitespace and is case sensitive.

canonical units:: Representative units of the physical quantity. Unless it is dimensionless, a variable with a **`standard_name`** attribute must have units which are physically equivalent (not necessarily identical) to the canonical units, possibly modified by an operation specified by either the standard name modifier (see below and <<standard-name-modifiers>>) or by the **`cell_methods`** attribute (see <<cell-methods>> and <<appendix-cell-methods>>).

description:: The description is meant to clarify the qualifiers of the fundamental quantities such as which surface a quantity is defined on or what the flux sign conventions are. We don"t attempt to provide precise definitions of fundumental physical quantities (e.g., temperature) which may be found in the literature.

When appropriate, the table entry also contains the corresponding GRIB parameter code(s) (from ECMWF and NCEP) and AMIP identifiers.

The standard name table is located at
http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/src/cf-standard-name-table.xml,
written in compliance with the XML format, as described in
<<standard-name-table-format>>. Knowledge of the XML format is only necessary
for application writers who plan to directly access the table. A formatted text
version of the table is provided at
http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html,
and this table may be consulted in order to find the standard name that should
be assigned to a variable. Some standard names (e.g. **`region`** and
**`area_type`**) are used to indicate quantities which are permitted to take
only certain standard values. This is indicated in the definition of the
quantity in the standard name table, accompanied by a list or a link to a list
of the permitted values.

Standard names by themselves are not always sufficient to describe a quantity. For example, a variable may contain data to which spatial or temporal operations have been applied. Or the data may represent an uncertainty in the measurement of a quantity. These quantity attributes are expressed as modifiers of the standard name. Modifications due to common statistical operations are expressed via the **`cell_methods`** attribute (see <<cell-methods>> and <<appendix-cell-methods>>). Other types of quantity modifiers are expressed using the optional modifier part of the **`standard_name`** attribute. The permissible values of these modifiers are given in <<standard-name-modifiers>>.

[[ancillary-data, Section 3.4, "Ancillary Data"]]
=== Ancillary Data

When one data variable provides metadata about the individual values of another data variable it may be desirable to express this association by providing a link between the variables. For example, instrument data may have associated measures of uncertainty. The attribute **`ancillary_variables`** is used to express these types of relationships. It is a string attribute whose value is a blank separated list of variable names. The nature of the relationship between variables associated via **`ancillary_variables`** must be determined by other attributes. The variables listed by the **`ancillary_variables`** attribute will often have the standard name of the variable which points to them including a modifier (<<standard-name-modifiers>>) to indicate the relationship.

[[flags, Section 3.5, "Flags"]]
=== Flags

The attributes **`flag_values`**, **`flag_masks`** and
**`flag_meanings`** are intended to make variables that contain flag
values self describing. Status codes and Boolean (binary) condition
flags may be expressed with different combinations of **`flag_values`**
and **`flag_masks`** attribute definitions.

The **`flag_values`** and **`flag_meanings`** attributes describe a
status flag consisting of mutually exclusive coded values. The
**`flag_values`** attribute is the same type as the variable to which it
is attached, and contains a list of the possible flag values. The
**`flag_meanings`** attribute is a string whose value is a blank
separated list of descriptive words or phrases, one for each flag value.
Each word or phrase should consist of characters from the alphanumeric
set and the following five: '_', '-', '.', '+', '@'. If multi-word
phrases are used to describe the flag values, then the words within a
phrase should be connected with underscores. The following example
illustrates the use of flag values to express a speed quality with an
enumerated status code.

  byte current_speed_qc(time, depth, lat, lon) ;
    current_speed_qc:long_name = "Current Speed Quality" ;
    current_speed_qc:standard_name = "status_flag" ;
    current_speed_qc:_FillValue = -128b ;
    current_speed_qc:valid_range = 0b, 2b ;
    current_speed_qc:flag_values = 0b, 1b, 2b ;
    current_speed_qc:flag_meanings = "quality_good sensor_nonfunctional 
                                      outside_valid_range" ;
----

Note that the data variable containing current speed has an ancillary_variables 
attribute with a value containing current_speed_qc.


====

The **`flag_masks`** and **`flag_meanings`** attributes describe a
number of independent Boolean conditions using bit field notation by
setting unique bits in each **`flag_masks`** value.  **`The
flag_masks`** attribute is the same type as the variable to which it is
attached, and contains a list of values matching unique bit fields.  The
**`flag_meanings`** attribute is defined as above, one for each
**`flag_masks`** value.  A flagged condition is identified by performing
a bitwise AND of the variable value and each **`flag_masks`** value; a
non-zero result indicates a **`true`** condition.  Thus, any or all of
the flagged conditions may be **`true`**, depending on the variable bit
settings. The following example illustrates the use of **`flag_masks`**
to express six sensor status conditions.

    sensor_status_qc:flag_masks = 1b, 2b, 4b, 8b, 16b, 32b ;
    sensor_status_qc:flag_meanings = "low_battery processor_fault
                                      memory_fault disk_fault
                                      software_fault
                                      maintenance_required" ;
----


====

The **`flag_masks`**, **`flag_values`** and **`flag_meanings`**
attributes, used together, describe a blend of independent Boolean
conditions and enumerated status codes.  The **`flag_masks`** and
**`flag_values`** attributes are both the same type as the variable to
which they are attached.  A flagged condition is identified by a bitwise
AND of the variable value and each **`flag_masks`** value; a result that
matches the **`flag_values`** value indicates a **`true`** condition.
Repeated **`flag_masks`** define a bit field mask that identifies a
number of status conditions with different **`flag_values`**.  The
**`flag_meanings`** attribute is defined as above, one for each
**`flag_masks`** bit field and **`flag_values`** definition.  Each
**`flag_values`** and **`flag_masks`** value must coincide with a
**`flag_meanings`** value.  The following example illustrates the use of
**`flag_masks`** and **`flag_values`** to express two sensor status
conditions and one enumerated status code.

    sensor_status_qc:flag_masks = 1b, 2b, 12b, 12b, 12b ;
    sensor_status_qc:flag_values = 1b, 2b, 4b, 8b, 12b ;
    sensor_status_qc:flag_meanings =
         "low_battery

          offline_mode calibration_mode maintenance_mode" ;

====

In this case, mutually exclusive values are blended with Boolean values
to maximize use of the available bits in a flag value.  The table below
represents the four binary digits (bits) expressed by the
**`sensor_status_qc`** variable in the previous example.

Bit 0 and Bit 1 are Boolean values indicating a low battery condition and a hardware fault, respectively. The next two bits (Bit 2 and Bit 3) express an enumeration indicating abnormal sensor operating modes. Thus, if Bit 0 is set, the battery is low and if Bit 1 is set, there is a hardware fault - independent of the current sensor operating mode.

[[table-flag-variable-bits]]
.Flag Variable Bits (from Example)
[options="header",caption="Table 3.2. "]
|===============
| Bit 3 (MSB) | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0 (LSB)
| | | H/W Fault | Low Batt
|===============

The remaining bits (Bit 2 and Bit 3) are decoded as follows:

[[table-flag-variable-bit-2-and-3]]
.Flag Variable Bit 2 and Bit 3 (from Example)
[options="header",caption="Table 3.3. "]

| Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Mode

| 1 | 1 | maintenance_mode
|===============

The "12b" flag mask is repeated in the **`sensor_status_qc`**
**`flag_masks`** definition to explicitly declare the recommended bit
field masks to repeatedly AND with the variable value while searching
for matching enumerated values. An application determines if any of the
conditions declared in the **`flag_meanings`** list are **`true`** by
simply iterating through each of the **`flag_masks`** and AND'ing them
with the variable. When a result is equal to the corresponding
**`flag_values`** element, that condition is **`true`**. The repeated
**`flag_masks`** enable a simple mechanism for clients to detect all
possible conditions.
