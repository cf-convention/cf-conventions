==  Description of the Data

The attributes described in this section are used to provide a description of the content and the units of measurement for each variable.
We continue to support the use of the **`units`** and **`long_name`** attributes as defined in COARDS.
We extend COARDS by adding the optional **`standard_name`** attribute which is used to provide unique identifiers for variables.
This is important for data exchange since one cannot necessarily identify a particular variable based on the name assigned to it by the institution that provided the data.

The **`standard_name`** attribute can be used to identify variables that contain coordinate data.
But since it is an optional attribute, applications that implement these standards must continue to be able to identify coordinate types based on the COARDS conventions.

[[units, Section 3.1, "Units"]]
=== Units

The **`units`** attribute is required for all variables that represent dimensional quantities (except for boundary variables defined in <<cell-boundaries>> and climatology variables defined in <<climatological-statistics>>).
The **`units`** attribute is permitted but not required for dimensionless quantities (see <<dimensionless-units>>).

The value of the **`units`** attribute is a string that can be recognized by the UDUNITS package <<UDUNITS>>, with the exceptions that are given in <<dimensionless-units>> and <<units-multiples>>.
Note that case is significant in the **`units`** strings.
Note also that CF depends on UDUNITS only for the definition of legal **`units`** strings.
CF does not assume or require that the UDUNITS software will be used for **`units`** conversion.
In most **`units`** conversions, the sole operation on the data is multiplication by a scale factor.
Special treatment is required in converting the **`units`** of variables that involve temperature (<<temperature-units>>) and the **`units`** of time coordinate variables (<<time-coordinate>>).

The COARDS convention prohibits the unit `degrees` altogether, but this unit is not forbidden by the CF convention because it may in fact be appropriate for a variable containing, say, solar zenith angle.
The unit `degrees` is also allowed on coordinate variables such as the latitude and longitude coordinates of a transformed grid.
In this case the coordinate values are not true latitudes and longitudes, which must always be identified using the more specific forms of `degrees` as described in <<latitude-coordinate>> and <<longitude-coordinate>>.


[[dimensionless-units, Section 3.1.1, "Dimensionless units"]]
==== Dimensionless units

A variable with no **`units`** attribute is assumed to be dimensionless.
However, a **`units`** attribute specifying a dimensionless unit may optionally be included.
The canonical unit (see also <<standard-name>>) for dimensionless quantities that represent fractions, or parts of a whole, is `1`.
The UDUNITS package defines a few dimensionless units, such as `percent`, `ppm` (parts per million, 1e-6), and `ppb` (parts per billion, 1e-9).
As an alternative to the canonical **`units`** of `1` or some other unitless number, the **`units`** for a dimensionless quantity may be given as a ratio of dimensional units, for instance `mg kg-1` for a mass ratio of 1e-6, or `microlitre litre-1` for a volume ratio of 1e-6. Data-producers are invited to consider whether this alternative would be more helpful to the users of their data.

The CF convention supports dimensionless units that are UDUNITS compatible, with one exception, concerning the dimensionless units defined by UDUNITS for volume ratios, such as `ppmv` and `ppbv`.
These units are allowed in the **`units`** attribute by CF only if the data variable has no **`standard_name`**.
These units are prohibited by CF if there is a **`standard_name`**, because the **`standard_name`** defines whether the quantity is a volume ratio, so the **`units`** are needed only to indicate a dimensionless number.
 
Information describing a dimensionless physical quantity itself (e.g.
"area fraction" or "probability") does not belong in the **`units`** attribute, but should be given in the **`long_name`** or **`standard_name`** attributes (see <<long-name>> and <<standard-name>>), in the same way as for physical quantities with dimensional units.
As an exception, to maintain backwards compatibility with COARDS, the text strings `level`, `layer`, and `sigma_level` are allowed in the **`units`** attribute, in order to indicate dimensionless vertical coordinates.
This use of **`units`** is not compatible with UDUNITS, and is deprecated by this standard because conventions for more precisely identifying dimensionless vertical coordinates are available (see <<dimensionless-vertical-coordinate>>).

The UDUNITS syntax that allows scale factors and offsets to be applied to a unit is not supported by this standard, except for case of specifying reference time, see section <<time-coordinate>>.
The application of any scale factors or offsets to data should be indicated by the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes.
Use of these attributes for data packing, which is their most important application, is discussed in detail in <<packed-data>>.


[[temperature-units, Section 3.1.2, "Temperature units"]]
==== Temperature units

The **`units`** of temperature imply an origin (i.e. zero point) for the associated measurement scale.
When the temperature value is the degree of warmth with respect to the origin of the measurement scale, we call it an _on-scale temperature_.
When **`units`** of on-scale temperature are converted, the data may require the addition of an offset as well as multiplication by a scale factor, because the physical meaning of a numerical value of zero for an on-scale temperature depends on the unit of measurement.
On-scale temperature is _unique_ among quantities in the respect that the origin and the unit of measurement are both defined by the **`units`** and therefore cannot be chosen independently.
For all other quantities, the origin and the unit of measurement are independent.
Converting the unit of measurement alone, without changing the origin, does not change the meaning of zero.
For example (using **bold** to indicate a numerical data value), **0** `kilogram` is the same mass as **0** `pound`, and **0** `seconds since 1970-1-1` means the same as **0** `days since 1970-1-1`, but **0** `degC` is not the same temperature as **0** `degF` (= **-17.8** `degC`), because these two temperature **`units`** implicitly refer to measurement scales which have different origins.

On the other hand, when the temperature value is a _temperature difference_, which compares two on-scale temperatures with the same origin, the value of that origin is irrelevant as it cancels out when taking the difference.
Therefore to convert the **`units`** of a temperature difference requires only multiplication by a scale factor, without the addition of an offset.

The **`units`** attribute does not distinguish between on-scale temperatures and temperature differences.
This ambiguity also affects units of temperature raised to some power e.g. `K^2` or multiplied by other units e.g. `W m-2 K-1`, `degF/foot` or `degC m s-1`.
A **`standard_name`** (<<standard-name>>) or **`standard_name`** modifier (<<standard-name-modifiers>>) may clarify the intention, but they are optional.
Some statistical operations described by the **`cell_methods`** attribute (<<cell-methods>>; <<appendix-cell-methods>>) imply that temperature must be interpreted as temperature difference, but this attribute is optional too.

In order to convert the **`units`** correctly, it is essential to know whether a temperature is on-scale or a difference.
Therefore this standard strongly recommends that any variable whose **`units`** involve a temperature unit should also have a **`units_metadata`** attribute to make the distinction.
This attribute must have one of the following three values: `temperature: on_scale`, `temperature: difference`, `temperature: unknown`.
The **`units_metadata`** attribute, **`standard_name`** modifier (<<standard-name-modifiers>>) and **`cell_methods`** attribute (<<appendix-cell-methods>>) must be consistent if present.
A variable must not have a **`units_metadata`** attribute if it has no **`units`** attribute or if its **`units`** do not involve a temperature unit.

    Tdifference:cell_methods="area: mean";
----
====

With `temperature: unknown`, correct conversion of the **`units`** cannot be guaranteed.
This value of **`units_metadata`** indicates that the data-writer does not know whether the temperature is on-scale or a difference.
If the **`units_metadata`** attribute is not present, the data-reader should assume `temperature: unknown`.
The **`units_metadata`** attribute was introduced in CF 1.11.
In data written according to versions before 1.11, `temperature: unknown` should be assumed for all **`units`** involving temperature, if it cannot be deduced from other metadata.
We note (for guidance _only_ regarding `temperature: unknown`, _not_ as a CF convention) that the UDUNITS software assumes `temperature: on_scale` for **`units`** strings containing only a unit of temperature, and `temperature: difference` for **`units`** strings in which a unit of temperature is raised to any power other than unity, or multiplied or divided by any other unit.

With `temperature: on_scale`, correct conversion can be guaranteed only for pure temperature **`units`**.
If the quantity is an on-scale temperature multiplied by some other quantity, it is not possible to convert the data from the **`units`** given to any other **`units`** that involve a temperature with a different origin, given only the **`units`**.
For instance, when temperature is on-scale, a value in `kg degree_C m-2` can be converted to a value in `kg K m-2` only if we know separately the values in `degree_C` and `kg m-2` of which it is the product.


[[units-multiples, Section 3.1.3, "Scale factors and offsets"]]
==== Scale factors and offsets

UDUNITS recognises the SI prefixes shown in <<table-supported-units>> for decimal multiples and submultiples of units, and allows them to be applied to non-SI units as well.
UDUNITS offers a syntax for indicating arbitrary scale factors and offsets to be applied to a unit.
(Note that this is different from the scale factors and offsets used for converting between **`units`**, as discussed for temperature in <<temperature-units>>.)
This UDUNITS syntax for arbitrary transformation of **`units`** is not supported by the CF standard, except for the case of specifying reference time (<<time-coordinate>>).
The application of any scale factors or offsets to data should be indicated by the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes.
Use of these attributes for data packing, which is their most important application, is discussed in detail in <<packed-data>>.

[[long-name, Section 3.2, "Long Name"]]
=== Long Name

The **`long_name`** attribute is defined by the NUG to contain a long descriptive name which may, for example, be used for labeling plots.
For backwards compatibility with COARDS this attribute is optional.
But it is highly recommended that either this or the **`standard_name`** attribute defined in the next section be provided for all data variables and variables containing coordinate data, in order to make the file self-describing.
If a variable has no **`long_name`** attribute then an application may use, as a default, the **`standard_name`** if it exists, or the variable name itself.

[[standard-name, Section 3.3, "Standard Name"]]
=== Standard Name

A fundamental requirement for exchange of scientific data is the ability to describe precisely the physical quantities being represented.
To some extent this is the role of the **`long_name`** attribute as defined in the NUG.
However, usage of **`long_name`** is completely ad-hoc.
For many applications it is desirable to have a more definitive description of the quantity, which allows users of data from different sources (some of which might be models and others observational) to determine whether quantities are in fact comparable.
For this reason each variable may optionally be given a "standard name", whose meaning is defined by this convention.
There may be several variables in a dataset with any given standard name, and these may be distinguished by other metadata, such as coordinates (<<coordinate-types>>) and **`cell_methods`** (<<cell-methods>>).

A standard name is associated with a variable via the attribute **`standard_name`** which takes a string value comprised of a standard name optionally followed by one or more blanks and a standard name modifier (a string value from <<standard-name-modifiers>>).

The set of permissible standard names is contained in the standard name table.
The table entry for each standard name contains the following:

standard name:: The name used to identify the physical quantity.
A standard name contains no whitespace and is case sensitive.

canonical units:: Representative units of the physical quantity.
Unless it is dimensionless, a variable with a **`standard_name`** attribute must have units which are physically equivalent (not necessarily identical) to the canonical units, possibly modified by an operation specified by the standard name modifier (see below and <<standard-name-modifiers>>) or by the **`cell_methods`** attribute (see <<cell-methods>> and <<appendix-cell-methods>>) or both.

Units of time coordinates (<<time-coordinate>>), whose **`units`** attribute includes the word **`since`**, are _not_ physically equivalent to time units that do not include **`since`** in the **`units`**.
To mark this distinction, the canonical unit given for quantities used for time coordinates is **`s since 1958-1-1`**.
The reference datetime in the canonical unit (the beginning of the day i.e. midnight on 1st January 1958 at 0 `degrees_east`) is not restrictive; the time coordinate variable's own **`units`** may contain any reference datetime (after **`since`**) that is valid in its calendar.
(We use `1958-1-1` because it is the beginning of International Atomic Time, and a valid datetime in all CF calendars; see also <<leap-seconds>>.)
In both kinds of time **`units`** attribute (with or without **`since`**), any unit for measuring time can be used i.e. any unit which is physically equivalent to the SI base unit of time, namely the second.

description:: The description is meant to clarify the qualifiers of the fundamental quantities such as which surface a quantity is defined on or what the flux sign conventions are.
We don't attempt to provide precise definitions of fundumental physical quantities (e.g., temperature) which may be found in the literature.
The description may define rules on the variable type, attributes and coordinates which must be complied with by any variable carrying that standard name (such as in Example 3.5).

When appropriate, the table entry also contains the corresponding GRIB parameter code(s) (from ECMWF and NCEP) and AMIP identifiers.

The standard name table is located at
link:$$https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/src/cf-standard-name-table.xml$$[https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/src/cf-standard-name-table.xml],
written in compliance with the XML format, as described in <<standard-name-table-format>>.
Knowledge of the XML format is only necessary for application writers who plan to directly access the table.
A formatted text version of the table is provided at
link:$$https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html$$[https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html],
and this table may be consulted in order to find the standard name that should be assigned to a variable.
Some standard names (e.g. **`region`** and **`area_type`**) are used to indicate quantities which are permitted to take only certain standard values.
This is indicated in the definition of the quantity in the standard name table, accompanied by a list or a link to a list of the permitted values.

Standard names by themselves are not always sufficient to describe a quantity.
For example, a variable may contain data to which spatial or temporal operations have been applied.
Or the data may represent an uncertainty in the measurement of a quantity.
These quantity attributes are expressed as modifiers of the standard name.
Modifications due to common statistical operations are expressed via the **`cell_methods`** attribute (see <<cell-methods>> and <<appendix-cell-methods>>).
Other types of quantity modifiers are expressed using the optional modifier part of the **`standard_name`** attribute.
The permissible values of these modifiers are given in <<standard-name-modifiers>>.

[[ancillary-data, Section 3.4, "Ancillary Data"]]
=== Ancillary Data

When one data variable provides metadata about the individual values of another data variable it may be desirable to express this association by providing a link between the variables.
For example, instrument data may have associated measures of uncertainty.
The attribute **`ancillary_variables`** is used to express these types of relationships.
It is a string attribute whose value is a blank separated list of variable names.
The nature of the relationship between variables associated via **`ancillary_variables`** must be determined by other attributes.
The variables listed by the **`ancillary_variables`** attribute will often have the standard name of the variable which points to them including a modifier (<<standard-name-modifiers>>) to indicate the relationship.
The dimensions of an ancillary variable must be the same as or a subset of the dimensions of the variable to which it is related, but their order is not restricted, and with one exception:
If an ancillary variable of a data variable that has been compressed by gathering (<<compression-by-gathering>>) does not span the compressed dimension, then its dimensions may be any subset of the data variable's uncompressed dimensions, i.e. any of the dimensions of the data variable except the compressed dimension, and any of the dimensions listed by the **`compress`** attribute of the compressed coordinate variable.

====

Alternatively, **`ancillary_variables`** may be used as status flags indicating the operational status of an instrument producing the data or as quality flags indicating the results of a quality control test, or some other quantitative quality assessment, performed against the measurements contained in the source variable. 
In these cases, the flag variable will include a standard name that differs from that of the source variable and indicates the specific type of flag the variable represents.

The standard names table includes many names intended to be used in this situation, both general names meant to be used to flexibly represent any type of status or quality assessment, as well as names for specific quality control tests commonly applied to geophysical phenomena timeseries data.
Several examples are listed below:

.Sample flag variable standard names:
- **`status_flag`** and **`quality_flag`**: general flag categories for instrument status or quality assessment
- **`climatology_test_quality_flag`**, **`flat_line_test_quality_flag`**, **`gap_test_quality_flag`**, **`spike_test_quality_flag`**: a subset of standard name flags used to indicate the results of commonly-used geophysical timeseries data quality control tests (consult the standard names table for a full list of published flags)
- **`aggregate_quality_flag`**: flag indicating an aggregate summary of all quality tests performed on the data variable, both automated and manual (i.e. a master quality flag for a particular variable)

The following example illustrates the use of three of these flags to represent two independent quality control tests and an aggregate flag that combines the results of the two tests.

Note that the ancillary variables in this example are simplified to exclude  **`flag_values`**, **`flag_masks`** and **`flag_meanings`** attributes described in <<flags>> that they would ordinarily require
====

[[flags, Section 3.5, "Flags"]]
=== Flags

The attributes **`flag_values`**, **`flag_masks`** and **`flag_meanings`** are intended to make variables that contain flag values self describing.
Status codes and Boolean (binary) condition flags may be expressed with different combinations of **`flag_values`** and **`flag_masks`** attribute definitions.

The **`flag_values`** and **`flag_meanings`** attributes describe a status flag consisting of mutually exclusive coded values.
The **`flag_values`** attribute is the same type as the variable to which it is attached, and contains a list of the possible flag values.
The **`flag_meanings`** attribute is a string whose value is a blank separated list of descriptive words or phrases, one for each flag value.
Each word or phrase should consist of characters from the alphanumeric set and the following five: '_', '-', '.', '+', '@'.
If multi-word phrases are used to describe the flag values, then the words within a phrase should be connected with underscores.
The following example illustrates the use of flag values to express a speed quality with an enumerated status code.

                                      outside_valid_range" ;
----

Note that the data variable containing current speed has an ancillary_variables attribute with a value containing current_speed_qc.

====

The flag_masks and flag_meanings attributes describe a number of independent Boolean conditions using bit field notation by setting unique bits in each flag_masks value.
The flag_masks attribute is the same type as the variable to which it is attached, and contains a list of values matching unique bit fields.
The flag_meanings attribute is defined as above, one for each flag_masks value.
A flagged condition is identified by performing a bitwise AND of the variable value and each flag_masks value; a non-zero result indicates a true condition.
Thus, any or all of the flagged conditions may be true, depending on the variable bit settings.
The following example illustrates the use of flag_masks to express six sensor status conditions.

====

A variable with standard name of `region`, `area_type` or any other standard name which requires string-valued values from a defined list may use flags together with `flag_values` and `flag_meanings` attributes to record the translation to the string values.
The following example illustrates this using integer flag values for a variable with standard name `region` and `flag_values` selected from the link:$$https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/standardized-region-names.html$$[standardized region names] (see section 6.1.1).

====

The **`flag_masks`**, **`flag_values`** and **`flag_meanings`** attributes, used together, describe a blend of independent Boolean conditions and enumerated status codes.
The **`flag_masks`** and **`flag_values`** attributes are both the same type as the variable to which they are attached.
A flagged condition is identified by a bitwise AND of the variable value and each **`flag_masks`** value; a result that matches the **`flag_values`** value indicates a **`true`** condition.
Repeated **`flag_masks`** define a bit field mask that identifies a number of status conditions with different **`flag_values`**.
The **`flag_meanings`** attribute is defined as above, one for each **`flag_masks`** bit field and **`flag_values`** definition.
Each **`flag_values`** and **`flag_masks`** value must coincide with a **`flag_meanings`** value.
The following example illustrates the use of **`flag_masks`** and **`flag_values`** to express two sensor status conditions and one enumerated status code.

In this case, mutually exclusive values are blended with Boolean values to maximize use of the available bits in a flag value.
The table below represents the four binary digits (bits) expressed by the **`sensor_status_qc`** variable in the previous example.

Bit 0 and Bit 1 are Boolean values indicating a low battery condition and a hardware fault, respectively.
The next two bits (Bit 2 and Bit 3) express an enumeration indicating abnormal sensor operating modes.
Thus, if Bit 0 is set, the battery is low and if Bit 1 is set, there is a hardware fault - independent of the current sensor operating mode.

The "12b" flag mask is repeated in the **`sensor_status_qc`** **`flag_masks`** definition to explicitly declare the recommended bit field masks to repeatedly AND with the variable value while searching for matching enumerated values.
An application determines if any of the conditions declared in the **`flag_meanings`** list are **`true`** by simply iterating through each of the **`flag_masks`** and AND'ing them with the variable.
When a result is equal to the corresponding **`flag_values`** element, that condition is **`true`**.
The repeated **`flag_masks`** enable a simple mechanism for clients to detect all possible conditions.
