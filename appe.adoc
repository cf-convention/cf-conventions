| **`cell_methods`** | Units | Description

| `point` | __u__
| The data values are representative of points in space or time
(instantaneous). This is the default method for a quantity that is
intensive with respect to the specified dimension.

| `sum` | __u__
| The data values are representative of a sum or accumulation over the
cell. This is the default method for a quantity that is extensive with
respect to the specified dimension.


| `maximum` | __u__ | Maximum

| `maximum_absolute_value` | __u__ | Maximum absolute value

| `median` | __u__ | Median

| `mid_range` | __u__ | Average of maximum and minimum

| `minimum` | __u__ | Minimum

| `minimum_absolute_value` | __u__ | Minimum absolute value

| `mean` | __u__ | Mean (average value)

| `mean_absolute_value` | __u__ | Mean absolute value

| `mean_of_upper_decile` | __u__ | Mean of the upper group of data values defined by the upper tenth of their distribution 

| `mode` | __u__ | Mode (most common value)

| `range` | __u__ | Absolute difference between maximum and minimum

| `root_mean_square` | __u__ | Root mean square (RMS)

| `standard_deviation` | __u__ | Standard deviation
