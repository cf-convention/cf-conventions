== Revision History

=== Working version (most recent first)

* {issues}542[Issue #542]: Clarify and rearrange text of section 4.4 about time coordinate units and calendars; introduce new text and a diagram explaining leap-seconds in existing calendars; define leap_second keyword of units_metadata attribute; define utc and tai calendars; define "datetime" in section 1.3.
* {issues}166[Issue #166]: Clarify that time coordinate variables must have **`units`** containing **`since`** and a reference time; distinguish between canonical units of time with and without **`since`**.
* {issues}141[Issue #141]: Clarification that text may be stored in variables and attributes as either vlen strings or char arrays, and must be represented in Unicode Normalization Form C and encoded according to UTF-8.
* {issues}367[Issue #367]: Remove the AMIP and GRIB columns from the standard name table format defined by Appendix B.
* {issues}403[Issue #403]: Metadata to encode quantization properties
* {issues}530[Issue #530]: Define "the most rapidly varying dimension", and use this phrase consistently with the clarification "(the last dimension in CDL order)".
* {issues}163[Issue #163]: Provide a convention for boundary variables for grids whose cells do not all have the same number of sides.
* {issues}174[Issue #174]: A one-dimensional string-valued variable must not have the same name as its dimension, in order to avoid its being mistaken for a coordinate variable.
* {issues}237[Issue #237]: Clarify that the character set given in section 2.3 for variable, dimension, attribute and group names is a recommendation, not a requirement.
* {issues}515[Issue #515]: Clarify the recommendation to use the convention of 4.3.3 for parametric vertical coordinates, because the previous wording caused confusion.
* {issues}511[Issue #511]: Appendix B: New element in XML file header to record the "first published date"
* {issues}509[Issue #509]: In exceptional cases allow a standard name to be aliased into two alternatives
* {issues}501[Issue #501]: Clarify that data variables and variables containing coordinate data are highly recommended to have **`long_name`** or **`standard_name`** attributes, that **`cf_role`** is used only for discrete sampling geometries and UGRID mesh topologies, and that CF does not prohibit CF attributes from being used in ways that are not defined by CF but that in such cases their meaning is not defined by CF.
* {issues}477[Issue #477]: Period and hyphen allowed in attribute names
* {issues}500[Issue #500]: Appendix B: Added a **`conventions`** string to the standard name xml file format definition
