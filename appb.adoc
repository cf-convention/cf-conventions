== Standard Name Table Format

The CF standard name table is an XML document (i.e., its format adheres to the XML 1.0 <<XML>> recommendation).
The XML suite of protocols provides a reasonable balance between human and machine readability.
It also provides extensive support for internationalization.
See the W3C <<W3C>> home page for more information.

The document begins with a header that identifies it as an XML file:

----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
----

Next is the **`standard_name_table`** itself, which is bracketed by the tags **`&lt;standard_name_table&gt;`** and **`&lt;/standard_name_table&gt;`**.

----
<standard_name_table
 xmlns:xsi="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="CFStandardNameTable.xsd">
----

The content (delimited by the `&lt;standard_name_table&gt;` tags) consists of, in order,

----
  <institution>Name of institution here ... </institution>
  <contact>E-mail address of contact person ... </contact>
----

followed by a sequence of **`entry`** elements which may optionally be followed by a sequence of **`alias`** elements.
The **`entry`** and **`alias`** elements take the following forms:

----
  <entry id="an_id">
      Define the variable whose standard_name attribute has the value "an_id".
  </entry>
  <alias id="another_id">
      Provide alias for a variable whose standard_name attribute has the
        value "another_id".
  </alias>
----

The value of the **`id`** attribute appearing in the **`entry`** and **`alias`** tags is a case sensitive string, containing no whitespace, which uniquely identifies the entry relative to the table.
_This is the value used for a variable's `standard_name` attribute._

The purpose of the **`entry`** elements are to provide definitions for the **`id`** strings.
Each **`entry`** element contains the following elements:

----
  <entry id="an_id">
    <canonical_units>Representative units for the variable ... </canonical_units>
    <description>Description of the variable ... </description>
  </entry>
----

`Entry` elements may optionally also contain the following elements:

----
  <grib>GRIB parameter code</grib>
  <amip>AMIP identifier string</amip>
----

Not all variables have equivalent AMIP or GRIB codes.
ECMWF GRIB codes start with **`E`**, NCEP codes with **`N`**.
Standard codes (in the range 1-127) are not prefaced.
When a variable has more than one equivalent GRIB code, the alternatives are given as a blank-separated list.

The **`alias`** elements do not contain definitions.
Rather they contain the value of the **`id`** attribute of an **`entry`** element that contains the sought after definition.
The purpose of the **`alias`** elements are to provide a means for maintaining the table in a backwards compatible fashion.
For example, if more than one **`id`** string was found to correspond to identical definitions, then the redundant definitions can be converted into aliases.
It is not intended that the **`alias`** elements be used to accommodate the use of local naming conventions in the **`standard_name`** attribute strings.
Each **`alias`** element contains a single element:

----
  <alias id="an_id">
    <entry_id>Identifier of the defining entry ... </entry_id>
  </alias>
----

      <description>
          Air pressure at sea level is the quantity often abbreviated
          as MSLP or PMSL. sea_level means mean sea level, which is close
          to the geoid in sea areas.
      </description>
    </entry>
    <alias id="mean_sea_level_pressure">
      <entry_id>air_pressure_at_sea_level</entry_id>
    </alias>
  </standard_name_table>
----

The definition of a variable with the **`standard_name`** attribute **`surface_air_pressure`** is found directly since the element with **`id="surface_air_pressure"`** is an **`entry`** element which contains the definition.

The definition of a variable with the **`standard_name`** attribute mean_sea_level_pressure is found indirectly by first finding the element with the **`id="mean_sea_level_pressure"`**, and then, since this is an alias element, by searching for the element with **`id="air_pressure_at_sea_level"`** as indicated by the value of the **`entry_id`** tag.
====

It is possible that new tags may be added in the future.
Any applications that parse the standard table should be written so that unrecognized tags are gracefully ignored.
