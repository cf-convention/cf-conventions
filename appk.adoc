== Mesh Topologies

The CF attributes listed here may be used to define mesh topologies (<<mesh-topology-variables>>).
This list is intended as a summary of the attributes that have been standardized via the UGRID conventions <<UGRID>>, which should be consulted for further details.
UGRID attributes that are not currently recognised by the CF convensions are included in the list.

The "Type" values are **S** for string and **I** for integer.
The "Use" values are **MT** for mesh topology variables, **LIS** for location index set variables, **D** for data variables, **Do** for domain variables, and **Con** for connectivity index variables.

| Description

| **`boundary_node_connectivity`**
| S

| **`cf_role`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies the roles of mesh topology or location index set variables.

| **`coordinates`**
| S
| LIS
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic locations of the subset of mesh topology locations.

| S
| MT
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of the edges (commonly the midpoint).

| **`edge_dimension`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the dimension used to index the nodes in the edge connectivity variable.

| **`edge_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying all faces that share the same edge, i.e. are neighbours to an edge. 

| **`edge_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every edge the indices of its begin and end nodes.

| **`face_coordinates`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of faces. 

| **`face_dimension`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the dimension used to index the edges in the face connectivity variable.

| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every face the indices of its edges.

| **`face_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying all faces that share an edge with each face, i.e. are neighbours. 

| **`face_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every face the indices of its corner nodes.

| **`location`**
| S
| D, Do, LIS
| Specifies the location within the mesh topology at which the variable is defined.

| **`location_index_set`**
| S
| D, Do
| Specifies a variable that defines the subset of locations of a mesh topology at which the variable is defined.

| **`mesh`**
| S
| D, Do, LIS
| Specifies a variable that defines a mesh topology.

| **`node_coordinates`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables representing the node locations (latitude, longitude, or other spatial coordinates, and optional elevation or other coordinates).

| **`start_index`**
| I
| LIS, Con
| Indicates whether 0- or 1-based indexing is used to identify connected geometric elements; connectivity indices are 0-based by default.

| **`topology_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| Indicates the highest dimensionality of the geometric elements.
