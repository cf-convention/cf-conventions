[appendix]
== Attributes

All CF attributes are listed here except for those that are used to describe grid mappings. See Appendix F for the grid mapping attributes.

The "Type" values are **S** for string, **N** for numeric, and **D** for the type of the data variable. The "Use" values are **G** for global, **C** for variables containing coordinate data, **D** for variables containing non-coordinate data, **M** for geometry container variables, and **-** for variables with a special purpose. "Links" indicates the location of the attribute"s original definition (first link) and sections where the attribute is discussed in this document (additional links as necessary).
