[appendix]
== Attributes

All CF attributes are listed here except for those that are used to describe grid mappings and mesh topologies.
See <<appendix-grid-mappings>> for the grid mapping attributes, and <<appendix-mesh-topology-attributes>> for mesh topology attributes.

The "Type" values are **S** for string, **N** for numeric, and **D** for the type of the data variable.
Each attribute may be used in any of the ways shown in its "Use" entry.
**G** indicates it can appear as a global attribute, and **Gr** as a group attribute.
For variable attributes, the possible values of "Use" are: **C** for variables containing coordinate data, **D** for data variables, **M** for geometry container variables, **Q** for quantization container variables, **Do** for domain variables, **BI** and **BO** for boundary variables (see <<cell-boundaries>> for the distinction between **BI** and **BO**), and **-** for variables with some other purpose.
CF does not prohibit any of these attributes from being attached to variables of different kinds from those listed as their "Use" in this table, but their meanings are not defined by CF if they are used in these other ways.
"Links" indicates the location of the attribute"s original definition (first link) and sections where the attribute is discussed in this document (additional links as necessary).
