==  NetCDF Files and Components 

The components of a netCDF file are described in section 2 of the NUG <<NUG>>.
In this section we describe conventions associated with filenames and the basic components of a netCDF file.
We also introduce new attributes for describing the contents of a file.

=== Filename

NetCDF files should have the file name extension "**`.nc`**".

=== Data Types

// TODO: Check, should this be a bullet list?
Data variables must be one of the following data types: **`string`**, **`char`**, **`byte`**, **`unsigned byte`**, **`short`**, **`unsigned short`**, **`int`**, **`unsigned int`**, **`int64`**, **`unsigned int64`**, **`float`** or **`real`**, and **`double`** (which are all the link:$$https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/md_types.html$$[netCDF external data types] supported by netCDF-4).
The **`string`** type is only available in files using the netCDF version 4 (netCDF-4) format.
The **`char`** and **`string`** types are not intended for numeric data.
One byte numeric data should be stored using the **`byte`** or **`unsigned byte`** data types.
It is possible to treat the **`byte`** and **`short`** types as unsigned by using the NUG convention of indicating the unsigned range using the **`valid_min`**, **`valid_max`**, or **`valid_range`** attributes.
In many situations, any integer type may be used.
When the phrase "integer type" is used in this document, it should be understood to mean **`byte`**, **`unsigned byte`**, **`short`**, **`unsigned short`**, **`int`**, **`unsigned int`**, **`int64`**, or **`unsigned int64`**.

Strings in variables may be represented one of two ways - as atomic strings or as character arrays.
An n-dimensional array of strings may be implemented as a variable of type **`string`** with n dimensions, or as a variable of type **`char`** with n+1 dimensions where the last (most rapidly varying) dimension is large enough to contain the longest string in the variable.
For example, a character array variable of strings containing the names of the months would be dimensioned (12,9) in order to accommodate "September", the month with the longest name.
The other strings, such as "May", should be padded with trailing NULL or space characters so that every array element is filled.
If the atomic string option is chosen, each element of the variable can be assigned a string with a different length.
The CDL example below shows one variable of each type.

variables:

    char_variable:long_name = "strings of type char" ;
  string str_variable(strings) ;
    str_variable:long_name = "strings of type string" ;
----
====

The examples in this document that use string-valued variables alternate between these two forms.

=== Naming Conventions

Variable, dimension, attribute and group names should begin with a letter and be composed of letters, digits, and underscores.
By the word _letters_ we mean the standard ASCII letters uppercase `A` to `Z` and lowercase `a` to `z`.
By the word _digits_ we mean the standard ASCII digits `0` to `9`, and similarly _underscores_ means the standard ASCII underscore `_`.
Note that this is in conformance with the COARDS conventions, but is more restrictive than the netCDF interface which allows almost all Unicode characters encoded as multibyte UTF-8 characters (link:$$https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/file_format_specifications.html$$[NUG Appendix B]).
The netCDF interface also allows leading underscores in names, but the NUG states that this is reserved for system use.
ASCII period (.) and ASCII hyphen (-) are also allowed in attribute names only.

Case is significant in netCDF names, but it is recommended that names should not be distinguished purely by case, i.e., if case is disregarded, no two names should be the same.
It is also recommended that names should be obviously meaningful, if possible, as this renders the file more effectively self-describing.

This convention does not standardize any variable or dimension names.
Attribute names and their contents, where standardized, are given in English in this document and should appear in English in conforming netCDF files for the sake of portability.
Languages other than English are permitted for variables, dimensions, and non-standardized attributes.
The content of some standardized attributes are string values that are not standardized, and thus are not required to be in English.
For example, a description of what a variable represents may be given in a non-English language using the **`long_name`** attribute (see <<long-name>>) whose contents are not standardized, but a description given by the **`standard_name`** attribute (see <<standard-name>>) must be taken from the standard name table which is in English.

[[dimensions]]
=== Dimensions

A variable may have any number of dimensions, including zero, and the dimensions must all have different names.
__COARDS strongly recommends limiting the number of dimensions to four, but we wish to allow greater flexibility__.
The dimensions of the variable define the axes of the quantity it contains.
Dimensions other than those of space and time may be included.
Several examples can be found in this document.
Under certain circumstances, one may need more than one dimension in a particular quantity.
For instance, a variable containing a two-dimensional probability density function might correlate the temperature at two different vertical levels, and hence would have temperature on both axes.

If any or all of the dimensions of a variable have the interpretations of "date or time" (**`T`**), "height or depth" (**`Z`**), "latitude" (**`Y`**), or "longitude" (**`X`**) then we recommend, but do not require (see <<coards-relationship>>), those dimensions to appear in the relative order **`T`**, then **`Z`**, then **`Y`**, then **`X`** in the CDL definition corresponding to the file.
All other dimensions should, whenever possible, be placed to the left of the spatiotemporal dimensions.

Dimensions may be of any size, including unity.
When a single value of some coordinate applies to all the values in a variable, the recommended means of attaching this information to the variable is by use of a dimension of size unity with a one-element coordinate variable.
It is also acceptable to use a scalar coordinate variable which eliminates the need for an associated size one dimension in the data variable.
The advantage of using either a coordinate variable or an auxiliary coordinate variable is that all its attributes can be used to describe the single-valued quantity, including boundaries.
For example, a variable containing data for temperature at 1.5 m above the ground has a single-valued coordinate supplying a height of 1.5 m, and a time-mean quantity has a single-valued time coordinate with an associated boundary variable to record the start and end of the averaging period.

[[variables]]
=== Variables

This convention does not standardize variable names.

NetCDF variables that contain coordinate data are referred to as __coordinate variables__, __auxiliary coordinate variables__, __scalar coordinate variables__, or __multidimensional coordinate variables__.

[[missing-data, Section 2.5.1, "Missing data, valid and actual range of data"]]
==== Missing data, valid and actual range of data

The NUG conventions
(link:$$https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/attribute_conventions.html$$[NUG Appendix A, Attribute Conventions])
provide the **`_FillValue`**, **`missing_value`**, **`valid_min`**, **`valid_max`**, and **`valid_range`** attributes to indicate missing data.
Missing data is allowed in data variables and auxiliary coordinate variables.
Generic applications should treat the data as missing where any auxiliary coordinate variables have missing values; special-purpose applications might be able to make use of the data.
Missing data is not allowed in coordinate variables.

The NUG conventions for missing data changed significantly between version 2.3 and version 2.4.
Since version 2.4 the NUG defines missing data as all values outside of the **`valid_range`**, and specifies how the **`valid_range`** should be defined from the **`_FillValue`** (which has library specified default values) if it hasn't been explicitly specified.
If only one missing value is needed for a variable then we recommend  that this value be specified using the **`_FillValue`** attribute.
Doing this guarantees that the missing value will be recognized by generic applications that follow either the before or after version 2.4 conventions.

The scalar attribute with the name **`_FillValue`** and of the same type as its variable is recognized by the netCDF library as the value used to pre-fill disk space allocated to the variable.
This value is considered to be a special value that indicates undefined or missing data, and is returned when reading values that were not written.
The **`_FillValue`** should be outside the range specified by **`valid_range`** (if used) for a variable.
The netCDF library defines a default fill value for each data type (See the "Note on fill values" in link:$$https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/file_format_specifications.html#classic_format_spec$$[NUG Appendix B, File Format Specifications]).

The missing values of a variable with **`scale_factor`** and/or **`add_offset`** attributes (see <<packed-data>>) are interpreted relative to the variable's external values (a.k.a. the packed values, the raw values, the values stored in the netCDF file), not the values that result after the scale and offset are applied.
Applications that process variables that have attributes to indicate both a transformation (via a scale and/or offset) and missing values should first check that a data value is valid, and then apply the transformation.
Note that values that are identified as missing should not be transformed.
Since the missing value is outside the valid range it is possible that applying a transformation to it could result in an invalid operation.
For example, the default **`_FillValue`** is very close to the maximum representable value of IEEE single precision floats, and multiplying it by 100 produces an "Infinity" (using single precision arithmetic).

This convention defines a two-element vector attribute **`actual_range`** for variables containing numeric data.
If the variable is packed using the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes (see <<packed-data>>), the elements of the **`actual_range`** should have the type intended for the unpacked data.
The elements of **`actual_range`** must be exactly equal to the minimum and the maximum data values which occur in the variable (when unpacked if packing is used), and both must be within the **`valid_range`** if specified.
If the data is all missing or invalid, the **`actual_range`** attribute cannot be used.

=== Attributes

This standard describes many attributes (some mandatory, others optional), but a file may also contain non-standard attributes.
Such attributes do not represent a violation of this standard.
Application programs should ignore attributes that they do not recognise or which are irrelevant for their purposes.
Conventional attribute names should be used wherever applicable.
Non-standard names should be as meaningful as possible.
Before introducing an attribute, consideration should be given to whether the information would be better represented as a variable.
In general, if a proposed attribute requires ancillary data to describe it, is multidimensional, requires any of the defined netCDF dimensions to index its values, or requires a significant amount of storage, a variable should be used instead.
When this standard defines string attributes that may take various prescribed values, the possible values are generally given in lower case.
However, applications programs should not be sensitive to case in these attributes.
Several string attributes are defined by this standard to contain "blank-separated lists".
Consecutive words in such a list are separated by one or more adjacent spaces.
The list may begin and end with any number of spaces.
See <<attribute-appendix>> for a list of attributes described by this standard.

[[identification-of-conventions]]
==== Identification of Conventions

Files that follow this version of the CF Conventions must indicate this by setting the NUG defined global attribute **`Conventions`** to a string value that contains "**`CF-{current-version-as-attribute}`**".
The Conventions version number contained in that string can be used to find the web based versions of this document are from the link:$$https://cfconventions.org/$$[netCDF Conventions web page].
Subsequent versions of the CF Conventions will not make invalid a compliant usage of this or earlier versions of the CF terms and forms.

It is possible for a netCDF file to adhere to more than one set of conventions, even when there is no inheritance relationship among the conventions.
In this case, the value of the Conventions attribute may be a single text string containing a list of the convention names separated by blank space (recommended) or commas (if a convention name contains blanks).
This is the Unidata recommended syntax from NetCDF Users Guide, Appendix A.
If the string contains any commas, it is assumed to be a comma-separated list.

When CF is listed with other conventions, this asserts the same full compliance with CF requirements and interpretations as if CF was the sole convention.
It is the responsibility of the data-writer to ensure that all common metadata is used with consistent meaning between conventions.

The UGRID conventions, which are fully incorporated into the CF conventions, do not need to be included in the **`Conventions`** attribute.  

[[description-of-file-contents, Section 2.6.2, "Description of file contents"]]
==== Description of file contents

The following attributes are intended to provide information about where the data came from and what has been done to it.
This information is mainly for the benefit of human readers.
The attribute values are all character strings.
For readability in ncdump outputs it is recommended to embed newline characters into long strings to break them into lines.
For backwards compatibility with COARDS none of these global attributes is required.

The NUG defines **`title`** and **`history`** to be global attributes.
We wish to allow the newly defined attributes, i.e., **`institution`**, **`source`**, **`references`**, and **`comment`**, to be either global or assigned to individual variables.
When an attribute appears both globally and as a variable attribute, the variable's version has precedence.

**`title`**:: A succinct description of what is in the dataset.

**`institution`**:: Specifies where the original data was produced.

**`source`**:: The method of production of the original data.
If it was model-generated, **`source`** should name the model and its version, as specifically as could be useful.
If it is observational, **`source`** should characterize it (e.g., "**`surface observation`**" or "**`radiosonde`**").

**`history`**:: Provides an audit trail for modifications to the original data.
Well-behaved generic netCDF filters will automatically append their name and the parameters with which they were invoked to the global history attribute of an input netCDF file.
We recommend that each line begin with a timestamp indicating the date and time of day that the program was executed.

**`references`**:: Published or web-based references that describe the data or methods used to produce it.

**`comment`**:: Miscellaneous information about the data or methods used to produce it.

[[external-variables, Section 2.6.3, "External variables"]]
==== External Variables
The global **`external_variables`** attribute is a blank-separated list of the names of variables which are named by attributes in the file but which are not present in the file.
These variables are to be found in other files (called "external files") but CF does not provide conventions for identifying the files concerned.
The only attribute for which CF standardises the use of external variables is **`cell_measures`**.

[[groups, Section 2.7, "Groups"]]
=== Groups

Groups provide a powerful mechanism to structure data hierarchically.
This convention does not standardize group names.
It may be of benefit to name groups in such a way that human readers can interpret them.
However, files that conform to this standard shall not require software to interpret or decode information from group names.
References to out-of-group variable and dimensions shall be found by applying the scoping rules outlined below.

==== Scope

The scoping mechanism is in keeping with the following principal:

[quote, 'https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/groups.html[The NetCDF Data Model: Groups]']
"Dimensions are scoped such that they are visible to all child groups.
For example, you can define a dimension in the root group, and use its dimension id when defining a variable in a sub-group."

Any variable or dimension can be referred to, as long as it can be found with one of the following search strategies:

* Search by absolute path
* Search by relative path
* Search by proximity

These strategies are explained in detail in the following sections.

If any dimension of an out-of-group variable has the same name as a dimension of the referring variable, the two must be the same dimension (i.e. they must have the same netCDF dimension ID).

===== Search by absolute path

A variable or dimension specified with an absolute path (i.e., with a leading slash "/") is at the indicated location relative to the root group, as in a UNIX-style file convention.
For example, a `coordinates` attribute of `/g1/lat` refers to the `lat` variable in group `/g1`.

===== Search by relative path

As in a UNIX-style file convention, a variable or dimension specified with a relative path (i.e., containing a slash but not with a leading slash, e.g. `child/lat`) is at the location obtained by affixing the relative path to the absolute path of the referring attribute.
For example, a `coordinates` attribute of `g1/lat` refers to the `lat` variable in subgroup `g1` of the current (referring) group.
Upward path traversals from the current group are indicated with the UNIX convention.
For example, `../g1/lat` refers to the `lat` variable in the sibling group `g1` of the current (referring) group.

===== Search by proximity

A variable or dimension specified with no path (for example, `lat`) refers to the variable or dimension of that name, if there is one, in the referring group.
If not, the ancestors of the referring group are searched for it, starting from the direct ancestor and proceeding toward the root group, until it is found.

A special case exists for coordinate variables.
Because coordinate variables must share dimensions with the variables that reference them, the ancestor search is executed only until the local apex group is reached.
For coordinate variables that are not found in the referring group or its ancestors, a further strategy is provided, called lateral search.
The lateral search proceeds downwards from the local apex group width-wise through each level of groups until the sought coordinate is found.
The lateral search algorithm may only be used for NUG coordinate variables; it shall not be used for auxiliary coordinate variables.

[NOTE]
====
This use of the lateral search strategy to find them is discouraged.
They are allowed mainly for backwards-compatibility with existing datasets, and may be deprecated in future versions of the standard.
====

==== Application of attributes

The following attributes are optional for non-root groups.
They are allowed in order to provide additional provenance and description of the subsidiary data.
They do not override attributes from parent groups.

* `title`
* `history`

If these attributes are present, they may be applied additively to the parent attributes of the same name.
If a file containing groups is modified, the user or application need only update these attributes in the root group, rather than traversing all groups and updating all attributes that are found with the same name.
In the case of conflicts, the root group attribute takes precedence over per-group instances of these attributes.

The following attributes may only be used in the root group and shall not be duplicated or overridden in child groups:

* `Conventions`
* `external_variables`

Furthermore, per-variable attributes must be attached to the variables to which they refer.
They may not be attached to a group, even if all variables within that group use the same attribute and value.

If attributes are present within groups without being attached to a variable, these attributes apply to the group where they are defined, and to that group's descendants, but not to ancestor or sibling groups.
If a group attribute is defined in a parent group, and one of the child group redefines the same attribute, the definition within the child group applies for the child and all of its descendants.

[[aggregation-variables, Section 2.8, "Aggregation Variables"]]
=== Aggregation Variables

An __aggregation variable__ is a variable which has been formed by combining (i.e. aggregating) multiple __fragments__ stored in __fragment files__ that are external to the file containing the aggregation variable, i.e. the __aggregation file__.
The aggregation variable does not contain any actual data, instead it contains instructions on how to create its __aggregated data__ as an aggregation of the data from each fragment.

Aggregation provides the utility of being able to view, as a single entity, a dataset that has been partitioned across multiple files, whilst taking up very little space on disk (since the aggregation file contains no copies of the data in the fragments).
The fragment files may be CF-compliant or have any other format, thereby allowing an aggregation variable to act as CF-compliant view of non-CF datasets.
Storing aggregations is useful for data analysis, as it avoids the computational expense of deriving the aggregation at the time of analysis; and for archive curation, as the aggregation can act as a metadata-rich archive index.

An aggregation variable must be a scalar (i.e. it has no dimensions) and the value of its single element is immaterial.
It acts as a container for all of the usual attributes that describe the data, with the addition of two special attributes: one that defines the _aggregated dimensions_, i.e. the dimensions of the aggregated data; and one that provides the instructions on how the aggregated data is to be created.
The data type of the aggregated data is the same as the data type of the aggregation variable.

Any variable may be an aggregation variable, and being an aggregation variable does not affect its role within CF (i.e. data variable, coordinate variable, boundary variable, cell measure variable, etc.).

The details of how to encode and decode aggregation variables are given in this section, with examples provided in <<appendix-aggregation-examples>>.

The conventions do not currently offer guidance to dataset creators on how to decide if two or more fragments can be aggregated in this way.


[[aggregated-dimensions, Section 2.8.1, Aggregated Dimensions]]
==== Aggregated Dimensions

The aggregated dimensions must be stored with the aggregation variable's **`aggregated_dimensions`** attribute, and it is the presence of this attribute that identifies the variable as an aggregation variable.
The value of the **`aggregated_dimensions`** attribute is a blank separated list of the aggregated dimension names given in the order which matches the dimensions of the aggregated data.
If the aggregated data is scalar then the **`aggregated_dimensions`** attribute must be an empty string.
The aggregated dimensions must exist as dimensions in the aggregation file.

The interpretation of all variables needs to account for the fact that the aggregated dimensions of an aggregation variable have exactly the same status as the dimensions of a normal (i.e. non-aggregation) variable.
For instance:

* coordinate and auxiliary coordinate variables must share their dimensions with the aggregated dimensions of their aggregation data variable,
* an aggregation coordinate variable (which will be a scalar) must have the same name as its aggregated dimension,
* etc.

[[aggregated-data, Section 2.8.2, Aggregated Data]]
==== Aggregated Data

The fragments are conceptually organised into a __fragment array__ that has the same number of dimensions as the aggregated data.
Each dimension of the fragment array is called a __fragment dimension__, and corresponds to the aggregated dimension with the same position in the aggregated data.
The size of a fragment dimension is equal to the number of fragments that are needed to span its corresponding aggregated dimension.
See <<example-fragment-array>>.


The aggregated data is created by concatenating the fragments' data along each fragment dimension, in the order in which they appear in the fragment array.

Once the aggregated data has been created in memory, it has exactly the same status as the data of a normal (i.e. non-aggregation) variable.

|===============
Six fragments are arranged in a three-dimensional fragment array with shape `(1, 3, 2)`.
Each fragment spans the entirety of the Z dimension, but only a part of the Y-X plane.
The fragments combine to create three-dimensional aggregated data that has global `(Z, Y, X)` coverage, with shape `(17, 181, 360)`.
The Z aggregated dimension is spanned by 1 fragment, the Y aggregated dimension is spanned by 3 fragments, and the X aggregated dimension is spanned by 2 fragments.
See <<example-L.4>> for a CDL representation of this fragment array.
====

The fragment array is defined by the aggregation variable's **`aggregated_data`** attribute.
This attribute takes a string value comprising blank-separated elements of the form "__feature: variable__", where __feature__ is a case-sensitive keyword that identifies a feature of the fragment array, and __variable__ is a __fragment array variable__ that provides the feature's values for each fragment in the fragment array.
The order of elements in the **`aggregated_data`** attribute is not significant.

There are four standardized and mandatory features, given by the `file`, `format`, `address`, and `shape` keywords; and any amount of non-standardized features are also allowed:

`file`

The string-valued `file` fragment array variable defines how to find each fragment file.
In general it has the same shape as the fragment array, and its values specify the fragment file names.
Each file name must take one of the following forms:

* A fully qualified Uniform Resource Identifier (URI, i.e. one that starts with `file://`, `http://`, `s3://`, etc.).
If the aggregation file is moved to another location then it will still be able to access the fragment files which haven't moved.

* A file path that is relative to the current location of the aggregation file.
If the aggregation file is moved then the fragment files must also be moved to preserve their relative locations.

Multiple versions of a fragment may be provided if an extra trailing dimension is included in the `file` fragment array variable.
Each version is expected to contain equivalent information, so that any version whose file exists may be selected for use in the aggregated data.
This is useful when it is known in advance that various file locations will be possible for the fragment, but it is not known which of them will exist at any given future time.
For instance, this feature could be used to define remotely stored and locally cached versions of a fragment, allowing an application program to only commit to the expense of accessing the remote version if the local version does not exist.
Every fragment must have at least one version, but not all fragments need have the same number of versions.
If a fragment has fewer versions than some others, then its trailing dimension must be padded with missing values.
See <<example-L.2>>.

A fragment file name may contain any number of string substitutions, each of which is defined by the `file` fragment array variable's **`substitutions`** attribute.
The use of substitutions can save space in the aggregation file; and in the event that the fragment files are moved from their original locations it may be possible for the fragment file names to be modified by editing the **`substitutions`** attribute, rather than by changing the `file` fragment array variable values themselves.
The **`substitutions`** attribute takes a string value comprising blank-separated elements of the form "__base: replacement__", where __base__ is a case-sensitive keyword that defines the part of a fragment file name which is to be replaced by the string defined by __replacement__ prior to locating and reading the fragment file.
The order of elements is not significant.
The _base_ keyword must have the form `${\...}`, where `\...` represents any characters.
For instance, a fragment file name of `\file://data/store/file.nc` could also be stored as `${local}file.nc`, in conjunction with `substitutions="${local}: \file://data/store/"`.
See <<example-L.3>>.

`format`

The string-valued `format` fragment array variable defines the format of the fragment files.
In general it has the same shape as the `file` fragment array variable, and must contain a non-missing value for each fragment.
However, if the `format` fragment array variable is a scalar, then its single value is assumed to apply to all fragments.
The format of a CF-netCDF fragment file must be indicated with the value `nc`.
Other fragment file formats are allowed, on the understanding that an application program may choose to ignore any values that it does not understand.

`address`

The `address` fragment array variable defines how to find the fragments within the fragment files.
In general it has the same shape as the `file` fragment array variable, and must contain a non-missing value for each fragment.
However, if the `address` fragment array variable is a scalar, then its single value is assumed to apply to all fragments.
It may have any data type.
For a CF-netCDF fragment file, the address must be the fragment's netCDF variable name.
Addresses for other fragment file formats are allowed, on the understanding that an application program may choose to ignore any values that it does not understand.

`shape`

The integer-valued `shape` fragment array variable defines the shape of each fragment in its canonical form (see <<fragment-interpretation>>).
In general, the `shape` fragment array variable is two-dimensional, with the size of the slower varying dimension (i.e. the number of rows) being the number of fragment dimensions, and the size of the more rapidly varying dimension (i.e. the number of columns) being the size of the largest fragment dimension.
Each row provides the sizes of the fragments along that dimension of the fragment array.
Rows that correspond to fragment dimensions that are smaller than the largest fragment dimension are padded with missing values.
When the aggregated data is a scalar there are no aggregated dimensions, and the `shape` fragment array variable must be one-dimensional, of size one, and contain the value `1`.
See <<appendix-aggregation-examples>>.

*Non-standardized features*

Any number of non-standardized features are allowed, on the understanding that an application program may choose to ignore any such features that it does not understand, or which are irrelevant for its purpose.
In general, the fragment array variable for a non-standardized feature has the same shape as the fragment array (possibly with extra trailing dimensions), and its values are assumed to apply to the corresponding fragments.
However, if the fragment array variable is a scalar, then its single value is assumed to apply to all fragments.

Use cases for non-standardized features include, but are not limited to:

* To provide extra information that enables the aggregation of fragments stored in a file format for which the `address` fragment array variable alone is insufficient to identify the fragments within the fragment files.

* To store extra metadata that relate to the fragments, but which are not necessary for the creation of the aggregated data.
For instance, it may be convenient to store in the aggregation file an attribute from each fragment file so that it is available without having to open and inspect the fragment files themselves.
See <<example-L.7>>.


[[fragment-interpretation, Section 2.8.3, Fragment Interpretation]]
==== Fragment Interpretation

The only restriction on the how a fragment is stored in a fragment file, of any format, is that the fragment must be convertible to its __canonical form__ by the application program that is creating the aggregated data.
A fragment must be converted to its canonical form prior to being inserted into the aggregated data.
It is up to the creator of the aggregation variable to ensure that it is possible to convert all fragments to their canonical forms.

The canonical form of a fragment is such that:

* The fragment's data, in its entirety, provides the values for a unique, contiguous part of the aggregated data.

* The fragment's data has the same number of dimensions as the aggregated data, and each of those dimensions must uniquely correspond to an aggregated dimension, and be in the same order.

* Each dimension of the fragment's data has the same sense of directionality (i.e. the sense in which it is increasing in physical space) as its corresponding aggregated dimension.

* The fragment's data has the same units as the aggregation variable. 

* The fragment's data is not packed (i.e. stored using a smaller data type than the original data).

* The fragment's data has the same data type as the aggregation variable.

* The fragment's data has the same indication of missing values as the aggregation variable.

The conversion of fragments to their canonical form is the responsibility of the application program which is creating the aggregated data, and it is up to the application program to decide what to do in the event that the conversion is not possible.

The application program is expected to allow some or all of the following operations:

* Inserting any omitted size 1 dimensions into the fragment's data (e.g. as required when aggregating two-dimensional fragments into three-dimensional aggregated data).

* Converting the fragment's data to have the aggregation variable's units (e.g. as required when aggregating time fragments whose units have different reference date/times).

* Casting the data type of the fragment's data to the aggregation variable's data type.
Note that some conversions may result in a loss of information (as could be the case when casting floating point numbers to integers), and an application program may choose to disallow these.

* Unpacking the fragment's data.
Note that if the aggregation variable indicates that the aggregated data is packed (as determinded by the attributes defined in <<packed-data>>), then the unpacked fragment data values represent packed values in the aggregated data.

* Replacing missing values in the fragment's data with values indicated by the aggregation variable as missing.
Note that it is up to the creator of the aggregation variable to ensure that the non-missing fragment data values do not coincide with any of the aggregation variable's missing values.
